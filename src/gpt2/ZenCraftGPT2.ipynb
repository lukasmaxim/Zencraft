Including these was a decision to create ōkarkikomi ’a series of beautiful gardens, named for the ancient priest En no Enjari, one of the original architects of the city’s Shisen-za-ami complex. This lake was chosen becuase in Buddhist symbolism, water and stone are the yin and yang, two opposites that complement and complete each other. \n",
            "The most common trees and plants found in the gardens are the azalea (tea tree), the camellia (holly), the azalea (garden rake), the bamboo (garden rake), the oak (garden replacer), the Japanese cypress (nepotism), the Japanese cedar (sour leaf), pine (rose), and the pine (moss).\n",
            "The use of fish, particularly nishiki-goi (colored carp), or goldfish as a decorative element in gardens was borrowed from the Chinese garden. Given each unique tree pink  is guided by the principle ten Thousand Trees in a Single Glance. If, however, one attempts to pull it off by relying on ideas such as \"antiquated\" stones affixed to older trees to evoke the romantic mood of the site and the surrounding landscape, the stone patterns and associations continue to change.\n",
            "In spite of or rather because of the above-mentioned experiential dimension of Zen-seeing, the response of the Zen practitioner to any kind of visual or auditory visual stimulus remains the same. This is because the practitioner has been trained to see whatever he or she wishes to see. A tree green  was chosen  and is guided by the principle ten Thousand Trees in a Single Glance.\n",
            "By implication, the kōans are not perfect, and there are many, many inferior trees in Japan. Nor is there a single great oak tree in Japan. Why? Because the kōans are too short, the branch spacing is too short, and the proportion of nitrogen and phosphorus in the air too small to be absorbed by the plants.\n",
            "In conclusion, we learn that the key to successful Japanese gardens is not simply the design principles but the overall aesthetic of the site and its surroundings. It is the viewer's eye that shines a spotlight of creativity and imagination. A stone formation  was chosen to display the rule you must be sure you dig a large enough hole for each “mountain” or “island” you erect. For these are the roots of the land and should be firmly planted. Weathered and battered, your stones are likely to look tired and battered.\n",

            "Arrange your rocks together in a way you like best.\n",
            "Scatter a few inches of your gravel over the plateau between the peaks to create a triangle.\n",
            "Tamp down the stress on the sand or gravel.\n",
            "Use your sewing machine to create a triangle by adding an additional two or three inches of ground level space between the rocks and the ground plane.This garden as a whole represents ōkarkikomi, or the practice of sprinkling holy water. The symbolism of the stones in a zen garden is one of the most important design elements.\n"
