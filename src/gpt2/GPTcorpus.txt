Zen Rock Garden - History, Philosophy, and How-To Guide
Komyozen-ji Rock Garden in Fukuoka, Japan
Originated in Japan, the Zen rock garden defies the definition of a "garden" in almost every conventional sense. It isn't a place to find rows of lush trees, an ornate gazebo, or a pond filled with beautiful fish. There is no field of green grass but sand, gravel, and sparse scattering of moss and nondescript shrubs. Nor is there much contrast in colors, as flowers are nowhere to be seen. Before learning how you may design and create a rock garden of your own, it's crucial to understand how this unique landscaping style has come to be and what fundamental philosophy is behind its creation.

Brief History - Evolution of the Japanese Rock Garden
5th - 8th Century
To understand the evolution of the Zen rock garden, we first need to look back to the fifth century when Chinese Taoism started to make an imprint on Japanese art. It is an ancient Taoist belief that somewhere in the middle of the ocean, there are three or five islands where immortals dwell. In Japanese literature, this belief is manifested in the form of a folktale about a fisherman named Urashima Taro who saves the life of a sea turtle, which in return, takes him to one of the immortal islands. There the fisherman marries a princess and becomes immortal. As time goes by, however, he is stricken with homesickness and decides to return to his old village. Sadly, not long after he sets foot on the familiar shore of his birthplace, the fisherman immediately grows old and dies
The Taoist immortal islands had not only inspired storytellers but also garden creators in Japan from the fifth to eighth century, so much so that the word for "garden" in those days was "shima", meaning "island." A typical Japanese garden in this period would usually comprise a large pond surrounded by lush trees. In the middle of the pond floated at least one island or sometimes just a big mountain-like rock, symbolizing the land of unfading youth and eternal life as appeared in the tale of Urashima Taro.
The Heian Period (Late 8th - 12th Century)
As Japan's capital was moved to Heian-Kyo (Kyoto) in 794, artists and garden makers began to avert their attention from Chinese Taoism and devoted their efforts to developing art that would reflect their own culture. Gardens were arranged in ways that portrayed Japanese natural landscapes, and Buddhism became a dominant, inspirational force behind their creations. Although the pond and islands remained the integral parts of Japanese gardens in this period, all the other elements were selected and organized in a much more scrupulous manner. For example, the constructions surrounding the garden must be connected to each other by lengthy covered galleries. There was a preference for deciduous trees whose shapes and colors would shift from season to season. Even birds in the trees and fish in the pond were considered parts of the garden composition.
This style of Japanese garden both depicts the core of Buddhism as well as the anxiety of civil wars that raged throughout the country in the second half of the Heian period. The incessantly altering state of the garden echoes the Buddhist teaching about the evanescence of our being and the never-ending cycle of death and rebirth. On the psychological level, it shows that the ominous wars had awakened people to recognize the precariousness of life and find reasons to be more sensitive to ephemeral beauty of nature; magnificent spring flowers that were so short-lived; colorful foliage that would die in the bitterness of winter.

The Muromachi Period (14th - 16th Century)
Around the late 11th century in the Heian period, dry rocky landscapes were built as a part of mainstream gardens. The professional landscapers back then were called "ishitate-so", meaning "monks who arrange rocks." It might sound a bit strange to us, modern citizens, but since Buddhism was so critical in the art of gardens in those days, it wasn't surprising at all that monks were the ones responsible for designing and creating Zen gardens. It wasn't until the Muromachi period that the Zen rock garden was fully developed, rose to its fame and continued its legacy to this day. Muso Soseki, a great Zen monk, was said to be the father of Zen landscaping who created some of the oldest rock gardens and brought popularity to this enigmatic landscaping technique.
While Heian gardens mirrored the vicissitudes of life, Muromachi rock gardens completely rejected transitory phenomena and meaningless facades of material world. Garden makers in this period stripped nature bare and created Zen gardens mainly out of rocks and sand, in order to reveal the true substance of life and nature. Occasionally, small evergreen bushes were added but not portrayed as the focal element. This doesn't mean that the Muromachi landscapers totally neglected the tradition of pond gardens of the earlier days, though. Zen rock gardens are basically pond gardens without water. Zen monks draw wavy patterns in the sand with a rake as a way to mimic undulating movements of streams. All the rocks in the garden also represent elements found in regular Japanese gardens, such as islands, mountains, trees, bridges and even animals. Muso Soseki beautifully summed up this idea of imaginary components in his poem, "Ode to the Dry Landscape":
Without a speck of dust being raised, the mountains tower up; without a single drop falling, the streams plunge into the valley. 
All the Zen gardens that come after the Muromachi period are an evolving part of its legacy. To this day, new rock gardens continue to emerge in Japan and various countries. There are countless variations born of modern landscapers' distinctive imagination and creativity. Yet, Zen gardens built in the Muromachi period always remain revered as the ancient prototypes of this unique landscaping style.
Philosophy Behind the Zen Rock Garden
Traditionally, Zen rock gardens are not meant for picnics or other recreational activities. It is a sacred realm for Zen monks to perform their daily practice. The Japanese word "niwa" that means "garden" nowadays actually denoted "a ritual space" in the ancient time. So how can a seemingly barren garden have such significance in those clergymen's practice? In Zen Buddhism, reading scriptures and reciting prayers are considered to be superficial activities. To attain enlightenment, one must also undergo long periods of sitting meditation as well as physical work. At the rock garden, Zen monks contemplate upon nature and search for the utmost freedom of the mind. The true purpose behind the sand raking isn't to create something aesthetically pleasing but to train their own thought; it is, in other words, an implicit form of moving meditation.
Buddha Nature - Zen is a branch of Buddhism, which should not be considered a religion, at least not in a conventional sense, as it has nothing to do with divine power or metaphysical theories of human existence. It is simply a school of thought or a mode of thinking. The main activity of being a Zen is not to study Zen, but rather, to study oneself and regain one's "original nature", which is often referred to as "Buddha nature." Everyone was born with Buddha nature, but as we age, we become attached to things and experiences we have encountered. To rediscover our Buddha nature doesn't mean to forget everything or to be na√Øve, but to see things with a mind that is open to all possibilities, ready to accept and to doubt; a mind that isn't hindered by ego, desires, prejudice or selfish obsession. Without realizing our Buddha nature, our activities will always be affected by our preconceived ideas and fragmented, spinning mind. We don't fully see anything as it is but receive everything just as an echo of ourselves. By stripping a garden to its bare bones, Zen monks create a miniature image of the universe in its rawest form, which they believe can remind humans of their own deepest nature.
Reality vs Manipulation of Nature - In a Zen rock garden, the rocks may represent mountains or trees or animals. The sand may symbolize an expanse of water or a waterfall slithering down a mountain. Yet, in reality, the rocks are just rocks, and the sand is just sand. This, in a profound way, reflects how humans habitually manipulate nature, assign meanings to things around us and in the process of that, fool ourselves into becoming obsessed with those empty values. Diamonds, for example, are something lots of people adore and long to own. Many are more than willing to pay high prices or even get in debt for a tiny piece of this gemstone. The diamond is supposed to represent luxury, beauty and eternal love. In many cases, it becomes a reason for envy, greed and superficial happiness. But in reality, isn't it just a shiny rock? Contemplating upon the bareness and simplicity of a Zen rock garden, one may learn how to perceive the true substance of nature and see things beyond their meaningless appearances.

How to Make a Japanese Rock Garden
Take a careful look at your backyard and decide where you want to build your rock garden. Decide on its size and shape. Most rock gardens are rectangular or square, but there's nothing wrong with building yours in a circular or irregular shape. Also, bigger doesn't necessarily mean better. A small Zen garden can bring just as much peace to your mind as a spacious one does.
Remove all the grass from the area on which you want to create your rock garden.
Dig a shallow trench of about two to three inches deep around the border.
Cover the area with a landscaping tarp. This will prevent weeds from growing and poking through the sand.
Tuck the edges of the tarp into the trench.
Put bricks or small rocks over the trench to secure the tarp and also to create the border for your garden. If you don't want to use bricks or rocks, you may build a low wooden fence over the trench instead. Bamboo is probably the most common type of wood for Zen garden borders.
Lay sand or gravel (or a mixture of both) all over the tarp. Try to make the surface as even as possible. If you live in an area that is very windy or has a long rainy season, gravel is a better material for your Zen garden, as it tends to be less affected by wind and rain.
Arrange some rocks on your Zen garden, then rake the sand to create an image of streams or ripples.
Add some moss, small bushes, a bench for meditation or some garden lamps if you like.
Your Zen garden is complete!
The ability to capture the essence of nature makes the Japanese gardens distinctive and appealing to observers. Traditional Japanese gardens are very different in style from occidental gardens. The contrast between western flower gardens and Japanese gardens is profound. "Western gardens are typically optimised for visual appeal while Japanese gardens are modelled with spiritual and philosophical ideas in mind." Japanese gardens have always been conceived as a representation of a natural setting. The Japanese have always had a spiritual connection with their land and the spirits that are one with nature, which explains why they prefer to incorporate natural materials in their gardens. Traditional Japanese gardens can be categorized into three types: tsukiyama (hill gardens), karesansui (dry gardens) and chaniwa gardens (tea gardens). The main purpose of a Japanese garden is to attempt to be a space that captures the natural beauties of nature.
The small space given to create these gardens usually poses a challenge for the gardeners. Due to the absolute importance of the arrangement of natural rocks and trees, finding the right material becomes highly selective. The serenity of a Japanese landscape and the simple but deliberate structures of the Japanese gardens are what truly make the gardens unique. "The two main principles incorporated in a Japanese garden are scaled reduction and symbolization."
Japanese gardens always have water, either a pond or stream, or, in the dry rock garden, represented by white sand. In Buddhist symbolism, water and stone are the yin and yang, two opposites that complement and complete each other. A traditional garden will usually have an irregular-shaped pond, or, in larger gardens, two or more ponds connected by a channel or stream, and a cascade, a miniature version of Japan's famous mountain waterfalls.
In traditional gardens, the ponds and streams are carefully placed according to Buddhist geomancy, the art of putting things in the place most likely to attract good fortune. The rules for the placement of water were laid out in the first manual of Japanese gardens, the Sakuteiki ("Records of Garden Making"), in the 11th century. According to the Sakuteiki, the water should enter the garden from the east or southeast and flow toward the west because the east is the home of the Green Dragon (seiryu) an ancient Chinese divinity adapted in Japan, and the west is the home of the White Tiger, the divinity of the east. Water flowing from east to west will carry away evil, and the owner of the garden will be healthy and have a long life. According to the Sakuteiki, another favorable arrangement is for the water to flow from north, which represents water in Buddhist cosmology, to the south, which represents fire, which are opposites (yin and yang) and therefore will bring good luck.
The Sakuteiki recommends several possible miniature landscapes using lakes and streams: the "ocean style", which features rocks that appear to have been eroded by waves, a sandy beach, and pine trees; the "broad river style", recreating the course of a large river, winding like a serpent; the "marsh pond" style, a large still pond with aquatic plants; the "mountain torrent style", with many rocks and cascades; and the "rose letters" style, an austere landscape with small, low plants, gentle relief and many scattered flat rocks.
Traditional Japanese gardens have small islands in the lakes. In sacred temple gardens, there is usually an island which represents Mount Penglai or Mount H≈çrai, the traditional home of the Eight Immortals.
The Sakuteiki describes different kinds of artificial island which can be created in lakes, including the "mountainous island", made up of jagged vertical rocks mixed with pine trees, surrounded by a sandy beach; the "rocky island", composed of "tormented" rocks appearing to have been battered by sea waves, along with small, ancient pine trees with unusual shapes; the "cloud island", made of white sand in the rounded white forms of a cumulus cloud; and the "misty island", a low island of sand, without rocks or trees.
A cascade or waterfall is an important element in Japanese gardens, a miniature version of the waterfalls of Japanese mountain streams. The Sakuteiki describes seven kinds of cascades. It notes that if possible, a cascade should face toward the moon and should be designed to capture the moon's reflection in the water. It is also mentioned in Sakuteiki that cascades benefit from being located in such a manner that they are half-hidden in shadows.
Rock, sand and gravel are an essential feature of the Japanese garden. A vertical rock may represent Mount Horai, the legendary home of the Eight Immortals, or Mount Sumeru of Buddhist teaching, or a carp jumping from the water. A flat rock might represent the earth. Sand or gravel can represent a beach, or a flowing river. Rocks and water also symbolize yin and yang (in and y≈ç in Japanese) in Buddhist philosophy; the hard rock and soft water complement each other, and water, though soft, can wear away rock.
Rough volcanic rocks (kasei-gan) are usually used to represent mountains or as steppingstones. Smooth and round sedimentary rocks (suisei-gan) are used around lakes or as steppingstones. Hard metamorphic rocks are usually placed by waterfalls or streams. Rocks are traditionally classified as tall vertical, low vertical, arching, reclining, or flat. Rocks should vary in size and color but from each other, but not have bright colors, which would lack subtlety. Rocks with strata or veins should have the veins all going in the same direction, and the rocks should all be firmly planted in the earth, giving an appearance of firmness and permanence. Rocks are arranged in careful compositions of two, three, five or seven rocks, with three being the most common. In a three-arrangement, a tallest rock usually represents heaven, the shortest rock is the earth, and the medium-sized rock is humanity, the bridge between heaven and earth. Sometimes one or more rocks, called suteishi ("nameless" or "discarded"), are placed in seemingly random locations in the garden, to suggest spontaneity, though their placement is carefully chosen.
In ancient Japan, sand (suna) and gravel (jari) were used around Shinto shrines and Buddhist temples. Later it was used in the Japanese rock garden or Zen Buddhist gardens to represent water or clouds. White sand represented purity, but sand could also be gray, brown or bluish black.
Selection and subsequent placement of rocks was and still is a central concept in creating an aesthetically pleasing garden by the Japanese. During the Heian period, the concept of placing stones as symbolic representations of islands ‚Äì whether physically existent or nonexistent ‚Äì began to take hold, and can be seen in the Japanese word shima, which is of "particular importance ... because the word contained the meaning 'island'" Furthermore, the principle of kowan ni shitagau, or "obeying (or following) the request of an object", was, and still is, a guiding principle of Japanese rock design that suggests "the arrangement of rocks be dictated by their innate characteristics". The specific placement of stones in Japanese gardens to symbolically represent islands (and later to include mountains), is found to be an aesthetically pleasing property of traditional Japanese gardens. Here are some of the aesthetic principles, as stated by Thomas Heyd:
Stones, which constitute a fundamental part of Japanese gardens, are carefully selected for their weathering and are placed in such a way that they give viewers the sense that they ‚Äònaturally‚Äô belong where they are, and in combinations in which the viewers find them. As such, this form of gardening attempts to emblematically represent (or present) the processes and spaces found in wild nature, away from city and practical concerns of human life
Rock placement is a general "aim to portray nature in its essential characteristics" ‚Äì the essential goal of all Japanese gardens. Furthermore,
while the cult of stones is also central to Japanese gardening ‚Ä¶ as stones were part of an aesthetic design and had to be placed so that their positions appeared natural and their relationships harmonious. The concentration of the interest on such detail as the shape of a rock or the moss on a stone lantern led at times to an overemphatic picturesqueness and accumulation of minor features that, to Western eyes accustomed to a more general survey, may seem cluttered and restless.
Such attention to detail can be seen at places such as Midori Falls in Kenroku-en Garden in Kanazawa, Ishikawa Prefecture, as the rocks at the waterfall's base were changed at various times by six different daimy≈çs.
In Heian-period Japanese gardens, built in the Chinese model, buildings occupied as much or more space than the garden. The garden was designed to be seen from the main building and its verandas, or from small pavilions built for that purpose. In later gardens, the buildings were less visible. Rustic teahouses were hidden in their own little gardens, and small benches and open pavilions along the garden paths provided places for rest and contemplation. In later garden architecture, walls of houses and teahouses could be opened to provide carefully framed views of the garden. The garden and the house became one.
Bridges first appeared in the Japanese garden during the Heian period. At By≈çd≈ç-in garden in Kyoto, a wooden bridge connects the Phoenix pavilion with a small island of stones, representing the Mount Penglai or Mount Horai, the island home of the Eight Immortals of Daoist teaching, the bridge symbolized the path to paradise and immortality.
Bridges could be made of stone (ishibashi), or of wood, or made of logs with earth on top, covered with moss (dobashi); they could be either arched (soribashi) or flat (hirabashi). Sometimes if they were part of a temple garden, they were painted red, following the Chinese tradition, but for the most part they were unpainted.
During the Edo period, when large promenade gardens became popular, streams and winding paths were constructed, with a series of bridges, usually in a rustic stone or wood style, to take visitors on a tour of the scenic views of the garden.
Japanese stone lanterns (Âè∞ÁÅØÁ±†, dai-d≈çr≈ç, "platform lamp") date back to the Nara period and the Heian period. Originally, they were located only at Buddhist temples, where they lined the paths and approaches to the temple, but in the Heian period they began to be used at Shinto shrines as well. According to tradition, during the Momoyama period they were introduced to the tea garden by the first great tea masters, and in later gardens they were used purely for decoration.
In its complete and original form, a dai-doro, like the pagoda, represents the five elements of Buddhist cosmology. The piece touching the ground represents chi, the earth; the next section represents sui, or water; ka or fire, is represented by the section encasing the lantern's light or flame, while f≈´ (air) and k≈´ (void or spirit) are represented by the last two sections, top-most and pointing towards the sky. The segments express the idea that after death our physical bodies will go back to their original, elemental form.
Stone water basins (tsukubai) were originally placed in gardens for visitors to wash their hands and mouth before the tea ceremony. The water is provided to the basin by a bamboo pipe, or kakei, and they usually have a wooden ladle for drinking the water. In tea gardens, the basin was placed low to the ground, so the drinker had to bend over to get water
Nothing in a Japanese garden is natural or left to chance; each plant is chosen according to aesthetic principles, either to hide undesirable sights, to serve as a backdrop to certain garden features, or to create a picturesque scene, like a landscape painting or postcard. Trees are carefully chosen and arranged for their autumn colors. Moss is often used to suggest that the garden is ancient. Flowers are also carefully chosen by their season of flowering. Formal flowerbeds are rare in older gardens, but more common in modern gardens. Some plants are chosen for their religious symbolism, such as the lotus, sacred in Buddhist teachings, or the pine, which represents longevity.
The trees are carefully trimmed to provide attractive scenes, and to prevent them from blocking other views of the garden. Their growth is also controlled, in a technique called niwaki, to give them more picturesque shapes, and to make them look more ancient. It has been suggested that the characteristic shape of pruned Japanese garden trees resemble trees found naturally in savannah landscapes. This resemblance has been used to motivate the so-called Savannah hypothesis. Trees are sometimes constrained to bend, in order to provide shadows or better reflections in the water. Very old pine trees are often supported by wooden crutches, or their branches are held by cords, to keep them from breaking under the weight of snow.
In the late 16th century, a new art was developed in the Japanese garden; that of ≈çkarikomi (Â§ßÂààËæº), the technique of trimming bushes into balls or rounded shapes which imitate waves. According to tradition this art was developed by Kobori Ensh≈´ (1579‚Äì1647), and it was most frequently practiced on azalea bushes. It was similar to the topiary gardens made in Europe at the same time, except that European topiary gardens tried to make trees look like geometric solid objects, while ≈çkarkikomi sought to make bushes look as if they were almost liquid, or in flowing natural shapes. It created an artistic play of light on the surface of the bush, and, according to garden historian Michel Baridon, "it also brought into play the sense of 'touching things' which even today succeeds so well in Japanese design."
The most common trees and plants found in Japanese gardens are the azalea (tsutsuji), the camellia (tsubaki), the oak (kashiwa), the elm (nire), the Japanese apricot (ume), cherry (sakura), maple (momiji), the willow (yanagi), the ginkgo (ich≈ç), the Japanese cypress (hinoki), the Japanese cedar (sugi), pine (matsu), and bamboo (take).
The use of fish, particularly nishiki-goi (colored carp), or goldfish as a decorative element in gardens was borrowed from the Chinese garden. Goldfish were developed in China more than a thousand years ago by selectively breeding Prussian carp for color mutations. By the Song dynasty (960‚Äì1279), yellow, orange, white and red-and-white colorations had been developed. Goldfish were introduced to Japan in the 16th century. Koi were developed from common carp (Cyprinus carpio) in Japan in the 1820s. Koi are domesticated common carp that are selected or culled for color; they are not a different species and will revert to the original coloration within a few generations if allowed to breed freely. In addition to fish, turtles are kept in some gardens. Natural environments in the gardens offer habitats that attract wild animals; frogs and birds are notable as they contribute with a pleasant soundscape.
The early Japanese gardens largely followed the Chinese model, but gradually Japanese gardens developed their own principles and aesthetics. These were spelled out by a series of landscape gardening manuals, beginning with Sakuteiki ("Records of Garden Making") in the Heian Period (794‚Äì1185). The principles of sacred gardens, such as the gardens of Zen Buddhist temples, were different from those of pleasure or promenade gardens; for example, Zen Buddhist gardens were designed to be seen, while seated, from a platform with a view of the whole garden, without entering it, while promenade gardens were meant to be seen by walking through the garden and stopping at a series of viewpoints. However, they often contain common elements and used the same techniques. Some basic principles are:
Miniaturization. The Japanese garden is a miniature and idealized view of nature. Rocks can represent mountains, and ponds can represent seas. The garden is sometimes made to appear larger by placing larger rocks and trees in the foreground, and smaller ones in the background.
Concealment (miegakure, "hide and reveal"). The Zen Buddhist garden is meant to be seen all at once, but the promenade garden is meant to be seen one landscape at a time, like a scroll of painted landscapes unrolling. Features are hidden behind hills, trees groves or bamboo, walls or structures, to be discovered when the visitor follows the winding path.
Borrowed scenery (shakkei). Smaller gardens are often designed to incorporate the view of features outside the garden, such as hills, trees or temples, as part of the view. This makes the garden seem larger than it really is.
Asymmetry. Japanese gardens are not laid on straight axes, or with a single feature dominating the view. Buildings and garden features are usually placed to be seen from a diagonal and are carefully composed into scenes that contrast right angles, such as buildings with natural features, and vertical features, such as rocks, bamboo or trees, with horizontal features, such as water.
According to garden historians David and Michigo Young, at the heart of the Japanese garden is the principle that a garden is a work of art. "Though inspired by nature, it is an interpretation rather than a copy; it should appear to be natural, but it is not wild."
Landscape gardener Seyemon Kusumoto wrote that the Japanese generate "the best of nature's handiwork in a limited space".
The chisen-shoy≈´-teien ("lake-spring-boat excursion garden") was imported from China during the Heian period (794‚Äì1185). It is also called the shinden-zukuri style, after the architectural style of the main building. It featured a large, ornate residence with two long wings reaching south to a large lake and garden. Each wing ended in a pavilion from which guests could enjoy the views of the lake. Visitors made tours of the lake in small boats. These gardens had large lakes with small islands, where musicians played during festivals and ceremonies worshippers could look across the water at the Buddha. No original gardens of this period remain, but reconstructions can be seen at Heian-jing≈´ and Daikaku-ji temple in Kyoto.
The Paradise Garden appeared in the late Heian period, created by nobles belonging to the Amida Buddhism sect. They were meant to symbolize Paradise or the Pure Land (J≈çdo), where the Buddha sat on a platform contemplating a lotus pond. These gardens featured a lake island called Nakajima, where the Buddha hall was located, connected to the shore by an arching bridge. The most famous surviving example is the garden of the Phoenix Hall of By≈çd≈ç-in Temple, built in 1053, in Uji, near Kyoto. Other examples are J≈çruri-ji temple in Kyoto, Enro-ji temple in Nara Prefecture, the Hokongoin in Kyoto, M≈çts≈´-ji Temple in Hiraizumi, and Shiramizu Amidado Garden in Iwaki City
Karesansui gardens (ÊûØÂ±±Ê∞¥) or Japanese rock gardens, became popular in Japan in the 14th century thanks to the work of a Buddhist monk, Mus≈ç Soseki (1275‚Äì1351) who built zen gardens at the five major monasteries in Kyoto. These gardens have white sand or raked gravel in place of water, carefully arranged rocks, and sometimes rocks and sand covered with moss. Their purpose is to facilitate meditation, and they are meant to be viewed while seated on the porch of the residence of the h≈çj≈ç, the abbot of the monastery. The most famous example is Ry≈çan-ji temple in Kyoto.
The tea garden was created during the Muromachi period (1333‚Äì1573) and Momoyama period (1573‚Äì1600) as a setting for the Japanese tea ceremony, or chanoyu. The style of garden takes its name from the roji, or path to the teahouse, which is supposed to inspire the visitor to meditation to prepare him for the ceremony. There is an outer garden, with a gate and covered arbor where guests wait for the invitation to enter. They then pass through a gate to the inner garden, where they wash their hands and rinse their mouth, as they would before entering a Shinto shrine, before going into the teahouse itself. The path is always kept moist and green, so it will look like a remote mountain path, and there are no bright flowers that might distract the visitor from his meditation. Early teahouses had no windows, but later teahouses have a wall which can be opened for a view of the garden.
Promenade or stroll gardens (landscape gardens in the go-round style) appeared in Japan during the Edo period (1600‚Äì1854), at the villas of nobles or warlords. These gardens were designed to complement the houses in the new sukiya-zukuri style of architecture, which were modeled after the teahouse. These gardens were meant to be seen by following a path clockwise around the lake from one carefully composed scene to another. These gardens used two techniques to provide interest: borrowed scenery ("shakkei"), which took advantage of views of scenery outside the garden such as mountains or temples, incorporating them into the view so the garden looked larger than it really was, and miegakure, or "hide-and-reveal", which used winding paths, fences, bamboo and buildings to hide the scenery so the visitor would not see it until he was at the best viewpoint. Edo period gardens also often feature recreations of famous scenery or scenes inspired by literature; Suizen-ji J≈çju-en Garden in Kumamoto has a miniature version of Mount Fuji, and Katsura Villa in Kyoto has a miniature version of the Ama-no-hashidate sandbar in Miyazu Bay, near Kyoto. The Rikugi-en Garden in Tokyo creates small landscapes inspired by eighty-eight famous Japanese poems.
Small gardens were originally found in the interior courtyards (naka-niwa, "inner garden") of Heian period palaces, and were designed to give a glimpse of nature and some privacy to the residents of the rear side of the building. They were as small as one tsubo, or about 3.3 square meters, whence the name tsubo-niwa. During the Edo period, merchants began building small gardens in the space behind their shops, which faced the street, and their residences, located at the rear. These tiny gardens were meant to be seen, not entered, and usually had a stone lantern, a water basin, steppingstones and a few plants. Today, tsubo-niwa are found in many Japanese residences, hotels, restaurants, and public buildings. A good example from the Meiji period is found in the villa of Murin-an in Kyoto. Totekiko is a famous courtyard rock garden.
A hermitage garden is a small garden usually built by a samurai or government official who wanted to retire from public life and devote himself to study or meditation. It is attached to a rustic house, and approached by a winding path, which suggests it is deep in a forest. It may have a small pond, a Japanese rock garden, and the other features of traditional gardens, in miniature, designed to create tranquility and inspiration. An example is the Shisen-d≈ç garden in Kyoto, built by a bureaucrat and scholar exiled by the shogun in the 17th century. It is now a Buddhist temple.
The first manual of Japanese gardening was the Sakuteiki ("Records of Garden Making"), probably written in the late eleventh century by Tachibana no Tohshitsuna (1028‚Äì1094). Citing even older Chinese sources, it explains how to organize the garden, from the placement of rocks and streams to the correct depth of ponds and height of cascades. While it was based on earlier Chinese garden principles, it also expressed ideas which were unique to Japanese gardens, such as islands, beaches and rock formations imitating Japanese maritime landscapes.
Besides giving advice, Sakuteiki also gives dire warnings of what happens if the rules are not followed; the author warns that if a rock that in nature was in a horizontal position is stood upright in a garden, it will bring misfortune to the owner of the garden. And, if a large rock pointed toward the north or west is placed near a gallery, the owner of the garden will be forced to leave before a year passes.
Another influential work about the Japanese garden, bonseki, bonsai and related arts was Rhymeprose on a Miniature Landscape Garden (around 1300) by the Zen monk Kokan Shiren, which explained how meditation on a miniature garden purified the senses and the mind and led to understanding of the correct relationship between man and nature.
Other influential garden manuals which helped to define the aesthetics of the Japanese garden are Senzui Narabi ni Yagyo no Zu (Illustrations for Designing Mountain, Water and Hillside Field Landscapes), written in the fifteenth century, and Tsukiyama Teizoden (Building Mountains and Making Gardens), from the 18th century. The tradition of Japanese gardening was historically passed down from sensei to apprentice. The opening words of Illustrations for designing mountain, water and hillside field landscapes (1466) are "If you have not received the oral transmissions, you must not make gardens" and its closing admonition is "You must never show this writing to outsiders. You must keep it secret".
These garden manuals are still studied today.
The Tale of Genji, the classic Japanese novel of the Heian period, describes the role of the Japanese garden in court life. The characters attend festivals in the old Kyoto imperial palace garden, take boat trips on the lake, listen to music and watch formal dances under the trees.
Gardens were often the subject of poems during the Heian period. A poem in one anthology from the period, the Kokin-Shu, described the Kiku-shima, or island of chrystanthemums, found in the Osawa pond in the great garden of the period called Saga-in.
I had thought that here only one chrysanthmum can grow. Who therefore has planted the other in the depths of the pond of Osawa? Another poem of the Heian period, in the Hyakunin isshu, described a cascade of rocks, which simulated a waterfall, in the same garden: The cascade long ago ceased to roar, But we continue to hear the murmur of its name.
In Japanese culture, garden-making is a high art, equal to the arts of calligraphy and ink painting. Gardens are considered three-dimensional textbooks of Daoism and Zen Buddhism. Sometimes the lesson is very literal; the garden of Saih≈ç-ji featured a pond shaped like the Japanese character shin (ÂøÉ) or xƒ´n in Chinese, the heart-spirit of Chinese philosophy, the newspaper character is ÂøÉ but it's the full cursive, the sousho style (ËçâÊõ∏) for shin that would be used; sousho, this well-named "grass writing", would be appropriate for gardening purpose indeed, for in cursive writing the character shapes change depending on the context and of course, since it is cursive, depending on the person -that is to say that the character would be done in a single pencil stroke, it would match the state of mind and the context rather than the newspaper print. However, usually the lessons are contained in the arrangements of the rocks, the water and the plants. For example, the lotus flower has a particular message; Its roots are in the mud at the bottom of the pond, symbolizing the misery of the human condition, but its flower is pure white, symbolizing the purity of spirit that can be achieved by following the teachings of the Buddha. 
The Japanese rock gardens were intended to be intellectual puzzles for the monks who lived next to them to study and solve. They followed the same principles as the suiboku-ga, the black-and-white Japanese inks paintings of the same period, which, according to Zen Buddhist principles, tried to achieve the maximum effect using the minimum essential elements.
"Catching a catfish with a gourd" by Josetsu
One painter who influenced the Japanese garden was Josetsu (1405‚Äì1423), a Chinese Zen monk who moved to Japan and introduced a new style of ink-brush painting, moving away from the romantic misty landscapes of the earlier period, and using asymmetry and areas of white space, similar to the white space created by sand in zen gardens, to set apart and highlight a mountain or tree branch or other element of his painting. He became chief painter of the Shogun and influenced a generation of painters and garden designers.
Japanese gardens also follow the principles of perspective of Japanese landscape painting, which feature a close-up plane, an intermediate plane, and a distant plane. The empty space between the different planes has a great importance, and is filled with water, moss, or sand. The garden designers used various optical tricks to give the garden the illusion of being larger than it really is, by borrowing of scenery ("shakkei"), employing distant views outside the garden, or using miniature trees and bushes to create the illusion that they are far away.
Zen gardens are uniquely symbolic landscapes that can reflect your inner artistry, as well as provide you with a meditative experience. These arrangements are more than just beautiful ‚Äì they‚Äôre functional!
Zen gardens are sometimes better known as Japanese rock gardens. These stylized, dry landscapes are mainly composed of rocks, moss, pruned trees and bushes, and layers of gravel or sand carefully raked to represent the flow of water.
The lack of plants around this garden is meant to emphasize the spiritual importance of the way you arrange the rocks, trees, moss, and gravel or sand. As a plus, this means far less maintenance for you than with typical gardens.
The placement of these objects is deeply rooted in Zen Buddhist teachings and philosophies, many of which date back centuries ago. Let‚Äôs take a closer look at that.
Zen gardens were first created in Zen Buddhist temples in Kyoto, Japan, during the Muromachi Period.
These gardens were essentially shallow sandboxes filled to the brim with either sand or gravel and later decorated with larger rocks of various shapes and sizes.
Put together, the large rocks and surrounding sand or gravel are meant to represent islands in the sea.
The upkeep of the sand or gravel is an especially important process. Creating the impression of ocean waves through raking is often used as an aid to meditation, especially about the true meaning of life.
As such, keeping a zen garden was meant to be a highly spiritual experience, and it is still considered one today.
The selection and placement of your larger rocks is ‚Äì by far ‚Äì the most important part of creating a Japanese rock garden.
In fact, there are certain rules you must follow in order to respect this ancient gardening tradition.
Choosing Stones
The first known manual of Japanese gardening is called the Sakuteiki (or ‚ÄúRecords of Garden Making‚Äù). It laid out very specific rules for choosing and placing stones in a zen garden, warning those that do not heed these rules will suffer great misfortune.
Rocks are typically classified as either tall vertical, low vertical, arching, reclining, or flat among Japanese gardeners. These classifications are made to symbolize different aspects of nature, which will be further discussed in the ‚ÄúZen Rock Garden‚Äù section below.
The type of rock chosen is just as vital as its shape. For instance, you must use igneous rocks, or rough mountain rocks that have sharp edges, to symbolize mountains. The borders of your Japanese zen garden should be smooth sedimentary rocks to keep in the gravel or sand.
The Sakuteiki also states that your stones should: Vary in color, shape, and size from one another. Not have bright colors that could distract the viewer from the whole picture. Have grains that generally run in the same direction.
Placing Stones
Once you have chosen your rocks, you need to be very careful about their placement around your garden. The harmony of the overall rock composition is meant to give its owner a sense of peace and tranquility.
All your stones must be placed with their best sides shown at all times and at all angles. This means that if a stone has an ugly-looking top, you must place it in a way that hides that fault, even if it leans at an odd angle.
Stones are rarely placed in simple, straight lines or in symmetrical patterns around your typical zen garden. The most common rock arrangement consists of a single group or even several groups ‚Äì of three rocks each.
Many Buddhists place two small rocks on either side of a tall vertical rock to represent Buddha and his two attendants. However, the placement of rocks is not as rigid as these rules would have you believe.
A new ‚Äúrule‚Äù was invented at the end of the Edo period: suteishi, which are discarded, or ‚Äúnameless‚Äù rocks placed at random to add a sense of spontaneity to the garden.
Adding Plants
Plants must be kept to an absolute minimum in a zen garden, as the emphasis is more on the stones and their placement around the garden.
Zen Rock Garden
The symbolism behind the stones is one of the most important (if not the most important) design elements in the creation of a Japanese rock garden.
Vertical stones (or taido rocks) are often used to represent trees (or the element of wood).
Flat, horizontal stones (or shintai rocks) represent flowing water.
Arching stones (or shigyo rocks) represent fire.
Low or reclining stones (or reisho and kikyaku rocks respectively) represent metal and the earth.
Feel free to experiment with different combinations, such as:
A tall vertical rock (wood) with a reclining rock (earth).
A short vertical rock (metal) and a flat rock (water).
A tall vertical rock (wood), a reclining rock (earth), and a flat rock (water).
Whichever arrangement you choose, just be sure that you balance the number of vertical and horizontal rocks in your zen garden.
You can also use your large stones to mimic other natural formations.
Karetaki
Your zen garden should absolutely lack a pond or body of water. If you really want to include a water-like feature, then you can design a karetaki, or dry waterfall.
All that‚Äôs necessary is to arrange your stones and sand or gravel into a waterfall-like shape. Typically, the waterfall‚Äôs cascade is represented through a tall, standing bluestone.
You can then create a karenagare, or raked sand river, to mimic a stream at the base of your waterfall.
Karesansui: Rock Sculptures
Depending on the size of your stone, you can use it to symbolize a mountain, an island, or a welcoming post if it‚Äôs placed at the entrance of your garden.
You can also create a kogetsudai, or gravel mountain, out of gravel or sand by shaping the substrate into a tall cone to represent Mount Fuji (or another mountain).
You can also create a simple bridge or pathway made of stone through your garden. This path can add a sense of distance to your zen garden, and you can use them as a focal point to aid meditation as well.
While most people may think all zen gardens must be grand, sweeping places, this is actually incorrect. Zen gardens are refuges unrestricted to their size or location, and can, in fact, be any size the owner wants ‚Äì so long as it provides them some form of peace in that space.
Even keeping a mini zen garden on your desk may help increase your concentration and reduce stress.
You might be unable to place as many stones or plants in this smaller zen garden, but arranging your chosen flora and stones, as well as drawing new patterns in your gravel or sand, can be just as meditative as keeping a much larger garden.
In fact, this tiny garden could be just the solace you need from an overwhelming workload throughout the day.
Zen Sand Garden
Using sand as opposed to gravel in your zen garden can create an interesting symbolic contrast.
The fluid quality of sand expresses a sense of changeability that juxtaposes the solid, timelessness of stone. It can also symbolize an empty mind (as opposed to one full of negative thoughts), or, when raked in swirls, represent how water laps at the edges of stones and islands.
Depending on how they are raked, these swirls can depict either raging or gentle waves. In much broader terms, sand may also symbolize the ocean surrounding the island of Japan.
In essence, a zen sand garden provides an interesting aesthetic, as well as a tangible balance to the rigidity of stones you choose to use.
How to Make a Zen Garden
While zen gardens may look simple to create and maintain, they are anything but. They may seem low maintenance on the surface, due to the lack of plants, but the raking process (especially for those who opt to use sand over gravel substrate) requires a surprising amount of concentration and skill.
There‚Äôs no mandatory upkeep, but the meaning behind these gardens lends itself to hard work.
This is also not a garden for those who want to grow more extravagant flora or keep much flora in general. Do keep these details in mind before you commit to developing a giant zen garden in your backyard.

Tamper.
Edging stones.
Rocks of various sizes and shapes.
White gravel or sand.

Landscape fabric.
Method
Mark a rectangular, flat area in your backyard to create your zen garden. A 12 x 18-foot rectangle may suffice on a smaller property. You must also take into account the appropriate sunlight and watering requirements of your plants if you plan to grow some in your garden as well.
A traditional zen garden is a walled-in space due to its personal, meditative nature. Most people, however, might not want to construct a large stone wall just for this one spot. In that case, you can invest in some cheaper lattice fencing instead, so as to achieve nearly the same effect. Of course, this would then be a separate project you need to undertake before you start on your zen garden, so be sure you plan your time accordingly. Just be sure your resulting gate is wide enough for you to bring your zen garden supplies in later.
Clear your rectangular space of any plants, weeds, stones, or other debris in the way.
Use your shovel to remove a few inches of soil from your marked area.
Hammer your stakes into the ground at each corner, tying your string between them to check the level with your sting level.
Use the steel garden rake to rake out any uneven spots until the ground is flat.
Tamp down the soil.
Place your edging stones. These stones will keep your gravel or sand inside.
If you plan to use any large stones or compile your gravel or sand together to represent mountains or islands, then be sure you dig a large enough hole for each ‚Äúmountain‚Äù or ‚Äúisland‚Äù you erect. You should also dig holes for any plants you install.
Place your larger rocks and plants in their respective holes. The ‚Äúmountain‚Äù rocks should be buried most of the way in the hole.
Place your landscape fabric over the soil. Make sure you cut holes in the fabric to accommodate your ‚Äúmountain‚Äù rocks and plants.
Arrange your rocks together in a way you like best.
Scatter a few inches of your gravel or sand, using your hoe to distribute it evenly. Finally, you can use your wooden Zen rake to create patterns in the substrate.
According to the Sakuteiki, the earliest surviving manual for Japanese garden design, one must first acquire an overall "feeling of the place" before arranging rocks onto a landscape. What does the scenery around it look like? What is its natural aesthetic mood? It's important to keep in mind that nature itself is a consummate artist. Even though we are modifying nature to suit our personal preference, we should still consider the fundamental atmosphere of the whole place.
The number of rocks used in a Zen garden varies, depending on the intention of each landscaper. The majestic rock garden at Ryoan-ji, for instance, contains only fifteen rocks and no shrubs, leaving a long stretch of empty space carpeted with grayish gravel. All of the rocks are of similar colors, and none has any distinctive features. Many have tried to decode this simplistic yet enigmatic arrangement, and there are more than a dozen well-known interpretations. One of the most popular theories is that the creator of the Ryoan-ji garden didn't intend to replicate an abstract version of a pond garden at all. Rather, the five groups of rocks in this garden stand for the five primordial elements: wood, fire, earth, metal and water. By contrast with the garden of Ryoan-ji, the one at Daisen-in, a sub temple of Daitoku-ji, is much smaller in size but has about a hundred rocks in it. Each rock was meticulously selected on account of its size, shade and figurative shape. For example, an oblong flat rock on a wavy sand pattern evokes the image of a ship sailing in the sea, while a small round stone next to an erect jagged rock reminds us of a turtle at the foot of a mountain.
You may create a rock garden similar to the one at Ryoan-ji if you want to give your landscape an airy and minimalistic feel. Or you may build one with multiple rocks of various shapes and sizes if you prefer your rock garden to appear more artistic and explicit like the Daisen-in garden. There is no right or wrong, no better or worse, in the art of Zen gardens. Whether you use fifteen or a hundred rocks, your Zen garden would still serve its purpose of bringing you closer to nature and peace. In case you have no idea where to start, think of a natural landscape or scenery that has a special meaning to you, and allow it to be your source of inspiration. Consider the positions of the main rocks or the bigger elements first, and the rest will naturally fall into place.
Since sunlight and water don't matter to it, a mini-Zen garden might be an excellent choice for those who don't have a backyard but would like to bring some nature into their home. Many websites and gift shops provide indoor Zen-garden kits containing a mini wooden rake, a small bag of sand, a wooden tray and an assortment of rocks. The prices usually range from $10 - $30 for tabletop-size ones. If you're inclined to exercise your creativity, you can also build your own indoor Zen garden from scratch. First, you have to pick a frame for your rock garden. Any type of shallow container will work. You may use a wooden serving tray, a shallow soup plate, a cardboard box or even a photo frame. As for decorative rocks and sand, you can buy them at a hardware store, art-supply shop or a department store that sells home d√©cor items. Garden-supply stores may offer a larger variety of these materials, yet they don't always sell them in small quantities. And last but not least, you also need a mini rake. On Amazon.com, they are sold at about $3 each. If you have a nice wooden fork or a small back scratcher, however, you may use that as a rake instead of buying a proper one. As mentioned earlier, there is no right or wrong in the art of Zen rock gardens, and that also applies to the miniature versions. You can be as innovative and resourceful as you'd like.
This content is accurate and true to the best of the author‚Äôs knowledge and is not meant to substitute for formal and individualized advice from a qualified professional.
Although Zen Buddhism eventually developed traditions of study and ritual, its emphasis on personal experience has always made it a practice-oriented tradition. The practice is meditation. ‚ÄúSitting Zen‚Äù (Japanese: zazen) has always been central in Zen training centers, where monks rise early each morning for meditation practice and do long retreats consisting of many, many silent unmoving hours on the cushion.
What is Zazen? It literally means ‚Äúsitting Zen.‚Äù Put simply, it‚Äôs ‚Äúseated meditation‚Äù as done in the Zen style ‚Äî upright in good posture, paying careful attention to breathing in your belly until you are fully alert and present.
Zazen is an intensely simple practice. It is generally taught without steps, stages, or frills. ‚ÄúJust sit!‚Äù the master admonishes, by which he or she means, sit upright in good posture, paying careful attention to breathing in your belly until you are fully alert and present. This sense of being present, with illumination and intensity, is the essence of zazen, and although there are many approaches to Zen meditation, they all come back to this.
Zen monk meditating.
In the Zen monastery, life is entirely organized around sitting in the meditation hall. But zazen is also understood to be something more than this sitting. It is conceived of as a state of mind or being that extends into all activities. Work is zazen; eating is zazen; sleeping, walking, standing, going to the toilet ‚Äî all are zazen practice. In Soto Zen, the Japanese school practiced extensively in the West, there is an especially strong emphasis on this ‚Äúmoving Zen.‚Äù Soto monastic life tends to be highly ritualized, so as to promote concentration in all things. There is, for instance, a special elegant and mindful practice, called oryoki, for eating ritualized meals in the meditation hall.
KOAN PRACTICE
In koan Zen, contemplation of a koan begins with zazen practice. The practitioner comes to intense presence with body and breath, and then brings up the koan almost as a physical object, repeating it over and over again with breathing, until words and meaning dissolve and the koan is ‚Äúseen.‚Äù
This practice is usually done in the context of an intensive retreat led by a qualified Zen koan teacher, whom the practitioner visits for private interviews. The student presents their understanding of the koan (however lame it may be) and receives a response from the teacher (however understated it may be) that reorients the search.
Eventually, with luck, diligence and a few judicious hints, the koan‚Äôs essence is penetrated.
Like all systems, the koan system can degenerate into a self-protective and self-referential enclosure. It‚Äôs the teacher‚Äôs job to see that this doesn‚Äôt happen, but sometimes it is not preventable. There are many different systems of koan study, but most of them emphasize humor, spontaneity, and openness. The koan method is, at its best, a unique and marvelous expression of human religious sensibility.
How did Zen Buddhism come to be?
Through the centuries, India, the first Buddhist country, gradually spawned hundreds of sects and sub-sects, and thousands of scriptures, and tens of thousands of commentaries on those scriptures. When Buddhism spread over Central Asian trade routes to China, all this material came at once. The Chinese had long cherished their own twin traditions of Confucianism and Taoism and were resistant to ideologies introduced by barbarians from beyond the borders of the ‚ÄúMiddle Kingdom.‚Äù There was also a severe linguistic challenge for the Chinese in digesting the Buddhist message from abroad. The Sanskrit language was so different from Chinese in sensibility and syntax that translation was almost impossible.
Gradually, Indian and Central Asian Buddhism began to be reshaped by its encounter with Chinese culture. This reshaping eventually led to the creation of Zen, an entirely new school of Buddhism, which eventually became by far the most successful school of Buddhism in China, Korea, Japan and Vietnam.
Schools of Zen Buddhism
Zen schools are more or less divisible into those that emphasize a curriculum of verbal meditation objects ‚Äî like koans ‚Äî and those that do not.
Emphasizing daily life practice as zazen, Soto Zen centers generally do not work with a set koan curriculum and method, though koans are studied and contemplated. Because of this, Soto Zen has sometimes been criticized by the koan schools (the best-known of which is the Rinzai school of Japan) as dull, overly precious, and quietistic, in contrast to the dynamic and lively engagement of the koan path. But the koan way also has its critics, who see the emphasis on words, meaning, and insight as working against real non-conceptual Zen living. Koan training systems also have the disadvantage of fostering competition and obsession with advancement in the system.
It is remarkable how essentially similar the various teachers within a particular Zen ‚Äúdharma family‚Äù can be in personal style and mode of expression, even though, paradoxically, each one is quite distinctive and individualistic.
Zen Buddhism has had a long and varied history in several different Far Eastern cultures. Each culture has produced a tradition that is recognizable as Zen but differs slightly from all the others. Vietnamese Zen is the one most influenced by the Theravada tradition. It tends to be gentle in expression and method, to emphasize purity and carefulness, and to combine Zen with some Theravada teaching and methodology.
In China, Zen eventually became the only Buddhist school, inclusive of all the others, so contemporary Ch‚Äôan includes many faith-based Mahayana practices that existed initially in other Buddhist schools, especially faith in and repetition of the name of Amida Buddha, the savior Buddha who will ensure rebirth in an auspicious heaven to those who venerate him.
Especially stylized, dramatic, and austere, Korean Zen includes prostration practice (repeated, energetic full-to-the-floor bows of veneration) and intensive chanting practice, and has a hermit tradition, something virtually unknown in Japanese Zen.
Within each of the Asian Zen traditions there are several schools, and within schools the styles of individual teachers often differ greatly. Still, it is remarkable how essentially similar the various teachers within a particular Zen ‚Äúdharma family‚Äù can be in personal style and mode of expression, even though, paradoxically, each one is quite distinctive and individualistic. This uncanny fact ‚Äî radical individuality within the context of shared understanding ‚Äî seems to be an indelible feature of Zen.
Before proceeding to expound the teaching of Zen at some length in the following pages, let me answer some of the questions which are frequently raised by critics concerning the real nature of Zen.
Is Zen a system of philosophy, highly intellectual and profoundly metaphysical, as most Buddhist teachings are?
I have already stated that we find in Zen all the philosophy of the East crystallized, but this ought not to be taken as meaning that Zen is a philosophy in the ordinary application of the term. Zen is decidedly not a system founded upon logic and analysis. If anything, it is the antipode to logic, by which I mean the dualistic mode of thinking. There may be an intellectual element in Zen, for Zen is the whole mind, and in it we find a great many things; but the mind is not a composite thing that is to be divided into so many faculties, leaving nothing behind when the dissection is over. Zen has nothing to teach us in the way of intellectual analysis; nor has it any set doctrines which are imposed on its followers for acceptance. In
this respect Zen is quite chaotic if you choose to say so. Probably Zen followers may have sets of doctrines, but they have them on their own account, and for their own benefit; they do not owe the fact to Zen. Therefore, there are in Zen no sacred books or dogmatic tenets, nor are there any symbolic formulae through which an access might be gained into the signification of Zen. If I am asked, then, what Zen teaches, I would answer, Zen teaches nothing. Whatever teachings there are in Zen, they come out of one's own mind. We teach ourselves; Zen merely points the way. Unless this pointing is teaching, there is certainly nothing in Zen purposely set up as its cardinal doctrines or as its fundamental philosophy. Zen claims to be Buddhism, but all the Buddhist teachings as propounded in the sutras and sastras are treated by Zen as mere wastepaper whose utility consists in wiping off the dirt of intellect and nothing more. Do not imagine, however, that Zen is nihilism. All nihilism is self-destructive, it ends nowhere. Negativism is sound as method, but the highest truth is an affirmation. When it is said that Zen has no philosophy, that it denies all doctrinal authority, that it casts aside all so-called sacred literature as rubbish, we must not forget that Zen is holding up in this very act of negation something quite positive and eternally affirmative. This will become clearer as we proceed.
Is Zen a religion? It is not a religion in the sense that the term is popularly understood; for Zen has no God to worship, no ceremonial rites to observe, no future abode to which the dead are destined, and, last of all, Zen has no soul whose welfare is to be looked after by somebody else and whose immortality is a matter of intense concern with some people. Zen is free from all these dogmatic and "religious" encumbrances.
When I say there is no God in Zen, the pious reader may be shocked, but this does not mean that Zen denies the existence of God; neither denial nor affirmation concerns Zen. When a thing is denied, the very denial involves something not denied. The same can be said of affirmation. This is inevitable in logic. Zen wants to rise above logic, Zen wants to find a higher affiramation where there are no antitheses. Therefore, in Zen, God is neither denied nor insisted upon; only there is in Zen no such God as has been conceived by Jewish and Christian minds. For the same reason that Zen is not a philosophy, Zen is not a religion. As to all those images of various Buddhas and Bodhisattvas and Devas and other beings that one comes across in Zen temples, they are like so many pieces of wood or stone or metal; they are like the camellias, azaleas, or stone lanterns in my garden. Make obeisance to the camellia now in full bloom, and worship it if you like, Zen would say. There is as much religion in so doing as in bowing to the various Buddhist gods, or as sprinkling holy water, or as participating in the Lord's Supper. All those pious deeds considered to be meritorious or sanctifying by most so-called religiously minded people are artificialities in the eyes of Zen. It boldly declares that "the immaculate Yogin‚Äôs do not enter Nirvana and the precept-violating monks do not go to hell". This, to ordinary minds, is a contradiction of the common law of moral life, but herein lies the truth and life of Zen. Zen is the spirit of a man. Zen believes in his inner purity and goodness. Whatever is superadded or violently torn away, injures the wholesomeness of the spirit. Zen, therefore, is emphatically against all religious conventionalism. Its irreligion, however, is merely apparent. Those who are truly religious will be surprised to find that after all there b so much of religion in the barbarous declaration of Zen. But to say that Zen is a religion, in the sense that Christianity or Mohammedanism is, would be a mistake. To make my point clearer, I quote the following. When Sakyamuni was born, it is said that he lifted one hand toward the heavens and pointed to the earth with the other, exclaiming, "Above the heavens and below the heavens, I alone am the Honored One!" Ummon (Yun-men), founder of the Ummon School of Zen, comments on this by saying, "If I had been with him at the moment of his uttering this, I would surely have struck him dead with one blow and thrown the corpse into the maw of a hungry dog."
What unbelievers would ever think of making such raving remarks over a spiritual leader? Yet one of the Zen masters following Ummon says: "Indeed, this is the way Ummon desires to ser\e the world, sacrificing everything he has, body and mind ! How grateful he must have felt for the love of Buddha!"
Zen is not to be confounded with a form of meditation as practiced by "New Thought" people, or Christian Scientists, or Hindu Sannyasins, or some Buddhists. Dhyana, as it is understood by Zen, does not correspond to the practice as carried on in Zen. A man may meditate on a religious or philosophical subject while disciplining himself in Zen, but that is only incidental; the essence of Zen is not there at all. Zen purposes to discipline the mind itself, to make it its own master, through an insight into its proper nature. This getting into the real nature of one's own mind or soul is the fundamental object of Zen Buddhism. Zen, therefore, is more than meditation and Dhyana in its ordinary sense. The discipline of Zen consists in opening the mental eye in order to look into the very reason of existence. To meditate, a man has to fix his thought on something, for instance, on the oneness of God, or his infinite love, or on the impermanence of things. But this is the very thing Zen desires to avoid. If there is anything Zen strongly emphasizes it is the attainment of freedom; that is, freedom from all unnatural encumbrances. Meditation is something artificially put on; it does not belong to the native activity of the mind. Upon what do the fowl of the air meditate? Upon what do the fish in the water meditate? They fly; they swim. Is not that enough? Who wants to fix his mind on the unity of God and man, or on the nothingness of this life? Who wants to be arrested in the daily manifestations of his life-activity by such meditations as the goodness of a divine being or the everlasting fire of hell? We may say that Christianity is monotheistic, and the Vedanta pantheistic; but we cannot make a similar assertion about Zen. Zen is neither monotheistic nor pantheistic; Zen defies all such designations. Hence there is no object in Zen upon which to fix the thought. Zen is a wafting cloud in the sky. No screw fastens it, no string holds it; it moves as it lists. No amount of meditation will keep ^¬´n in one place. Meditation is not Zen, neither pantheism nor monotheism provides Zen with its subjects of concentration. If Zen is monotheistic, it may tell its followers to meditate on the oneness of things where all differences and inequalities, enveloped in the all-illuminating brightness of the divine light, are obliterated. If Zen were pantheistic it would tell us that every meanest flower in the field reflects the glory of God.
But what Zen says is "After all things are reduced to oneness, where would that One be reduced?" Zen wants to have one's mind free and unobstructed; even the idea of oneness or all is a stumbling-block and a strangling snare which threatens the original freedom of the spirit. Zen, therefore, does not ask us to concentrate our Zen, therefore, does not ask us to concentrate our thought on the idea that a dog is God, or that three pounds of flax are divine. When Zen does this it commits itself to a definite system of philosophy, and there is no more Zen. Zen just feels fire warm and ice cold, because when it freezes, we shiver and welcome fire. The feeling is all in all, as Faust declares; all our theorization fails to touch reality. But "the feeling" here must be understood in its deepest sense or in its purest form. Even to say that "This is the feeling" means that Zen is no more there. Zen defies all concept making. That is why Zen is difficult to grasp. Whatever meditation Zen may propose, then, will be to take things as they are, to consider snow white and the raven black. When we speak of meditation, we in most cases refer to its abstract character; that is, meditation is known to be the concentration of the mind on some highly generalized proposition, which is, in the nature of things, not always closely and directly
connected with the concrete affairs of life. Zen perceives or feels and does not abstract nor meditate. Zen penetrates and is finally lost in the immersion. Meditation, on the other hand, is out- spoken dualistic and consequently inevitably superficial. One critic^ regards Zen as "the Buddhist counterpart of the 'Spiritual Exercises' of St. Ignatius Loyal". The critic shows a great inclination to find Christian analogies for things Buddhistic, and this is one of such instances. Those who have at all a dear understanding of Zen will at once see how wide of the mark this comparison is. Even superficially speaking, there is not a shadow of similitude between the exercises of Zen and those proposed by the founder of the Society of Jesus. The contemplations and prayers of St. Ignatius are, from the Zen point of view, merely so many fabrications of the imagination elaborately woven for the benefit of the piously minded; and in reality this is like piling tiles upon tiles on one's head, and there is no true gain in the life of the spirit. We can say this, however, that those "Spiritual Exercises" in some ways resemble certain meditations of Hinayana Buddhism, such as the Five Mind-quieting Methods, or the Nine Thoughts on Impurity, or the Six or Ten Subjects of Memory. Zen is sometimes made to mean "mind-murder and the curse of idle reverie". This is the statement of Griffin, the well-known author of Religions of Japan. ^ By "mind-murder" I do not know what he really means, but does he mean that Zen kills the activities of the mind by making one's thought fix on one thing, or by inducing sleep? Mr. Reischauer in his book^ almost endorses this view of griffins by asserting that Zen is "mystical self-intoxication". Does he mean that Zen is intoxicated in the "Greater Seir*; so called, as Spinoza was intoxicated in God? Though Mr. Reischauer is not quite clear as to the meaning of "intoxication", he may think that Zen is unduly absorbed in the thought of the "Greater Self" as the final reality in this world of particulars. It is amazing to see how superficial some of the uncritical observers of Zen are! In point of fact, Zen has no "mind" to murder; therefore, there is no "mind-murdering" in Zen. Zen has again no "self" as something to which we can cling as a refuge; therefore, in Zen again there is no "self" by which we may become intoxicated. The truth is, Zen is extremely elusive as far as its outward aspects are concerned; when you think you have caught a glimpse of it, it is no more there ; from afar it looks so approachable, but as soon as you come near it you see it even further away from you than before. Unless, therefore, you devote some years of earnest study to the understanding of its primary principles, it is not to be expected that you will begin to have a fair grasp of Zen. ‚ÄúThe way to ascend unto God is to descend into one's self these are Hugo's words. "If thou wishes to search out the deep things of God, search out the depths of thine own spirit‚Äù; ‚Äîthis comes from Richard of St. Victor. When all these deep things are searched out there is after all no "self". Where you can descend, there is no "spirit", no "God" whose depths are to be fathomed. Why? Because Zen is a bottomless abyss. Zen declares, though in a somewhat different manner: "Nothing really exists throughout the triple world; where do you wish to see the mind (or spirit = shin)? The four elements are all empty in their ultimate nature; where could the Buddha's abode be? ‚Äîbut lo! the truth is unfolding itself right before your eye. This is all there is to it‚Äîand indeed nothing more!" A minute's hesitation and Zen is irrevocably lost. All the Buddhas of the past, present, and future may try to make you catch it once more, and yet it is a thousand miles away. "Mind-murder" and "self-intoxication", forsooth! Zen has no time to bother itself with such criticisms. The critics may mean that the mind is hypnotized by Zen to a state of unconsciousness, and that when this obtains, the favorite Buddhist doctrine of emptiness {sunjata) is realized, where the subject is not conscious of an objective world or of himself, being lost in one vast emptiness, whatever this may be. This interpretation again fails to hit Zen aright. It is true that there are some such expressions in Zen as might suggest this kind of interpretation, but to understand Zen we must make a leap here. The "vast emptiness" must be traversed. The subject must be awakened from a state of unconsciousness if he does not wish to be buried alive. Zen is attained only when "self-intoxication" is abandoned and the "drunkard" is really awakened to his deeper self. If the mind is ever to be "murdered", leave the work in the hand of Zen; for it is Zen that will restore the murdered and lifeless one into a state of eternal life. "Be born again, be awakened from the dream, rise from the death, O ye drunkards!" Zen would exclaim. Do not try, therefore, to see Zen with the eyes bandaged; and your hands are too unsteady to take hold of it. And remember I am not indulging in figures of speech.
I might multiply many such criticisms if it were necessary, but I hope that the above have sufficiently prepared the reader's mind for the following more positive statements concerning Zen. The basic idea of Zen is to come in touch with the inner workings of our being, and to do this in the most direct way possible, without resorting to anything external or superadded. Therefore, anything that has the semblance of an external authority is rejected by Zen. Absolute faith is placed in a man's own inner being. For whatever authority there is in Zen, all comes from within. This is true in the strictest sense of the word. Even the reasoning faculty is not considered final or absolute. On the contrary, it hinders the mind from coming into the director communication with itself the intellect accomplishes its mission |when it works as an intermediary, and Zen has nothing to do with an intermediary except when it desires to communicate itself to others. For this reason, all the scriptures are merely tentative and provisory; there is in them no finality. The central fact of life as it is lived is what Zen aims to grasp, and this in the most direct and most vital manner. Zen professes itself to be the spirit of Buddhism, but in fact it is the spirit of all religions and philosophies.
When Zen is thoroughly understood, absolute peace of mind is attained, and a man lives as he ought to live. What more may we hope? Some say that as Zen is admittedly a form of mysticism it cannot claim to be unique in the history of religion. Perhaps so, but Zen is a mysticism of its own order. It is mystical in the sense that the sun shines, that the flower blooms, that I hear at this moment somebody beating a drum in the street. If these are mystical facts, Zen is brim-full of them. When a Zen master was once asked what Zen was, he replied, "Your everyday thought." Is this not plain and most straightforward? It has nothing to do with any sectarian spirit. Christians as well as Buddhists can practice Zen just as big fish and small fish are both contentedly living in the same ocean. Zen is the ocean, Zen is the air, Zen is the mountain, Zen is thunder and lightning, the spring flower, summer heat, and winter snow; nay, more than that, Zen is the man. With all the formalities, conventionalisms, and superadditions that Zen has accumulated in its long history, its central fact is very much alive. The special merit of Zen lies in this: that we are still able to see into this ultimate fact without being biased by anything. As has been said before, what makes Zen unique as it is practiced in Japan is its systematic training of the mind. Ordinary mysticism has been too erratic a product and apart from one's ordinary life; this Zen has revolutionized. What was up in the heavens, Zen has brought down to earth. With the development of Zen, mysticism has ceased to be mystical; it is no more the spasmodic product of an abnormally endowed mind. For Zen reveals itself in the most uninteresting and uneventful life of a plain man of the street, recognizing the fact of living in the midst of life as its meant to be lived. Zen schematically trains the mind to see this; it opens a man's eye to the greatest mystery as it is daily and hourly performed; it enlarges the heart to embrace eternity of time and infinity of space in its every palpitation ; it makes us live in the world as if walking in the garden of Eden ; and all these spiritual feats are accomplished without resorting to any doctrines but by simply asserting in the most direct way the truth that lies in our inner being.
Whatever else Zen may be, it is practical and commonplace and at the same time most living. An ancient master, wishing to show what Zen is, lifted one of his fingers, another kicked a ball, and a third slapped the face of his questioner. If the inner truth that lies deep in us is thus demonstrated, is not Zen the most practical and direct method of spiritual training ever resorted to by any religion? And is not this practical method also a most original one? Indeed, Zen cannot be anything else but original and creative because it refuses to deal with concepts but deals with having facts of life. When conceptually understood, the lifting of a finger is one of the most ordinary incidents in everybody's life. But when it is viewed from the Zen point of view it vibrates with divine meaning and creative vitality. So long as Zen can point out this truth in the midst of our conventional and concept bound existence, we must say that it has its reason of being. The following quotation fi-om a letter of Yengo (Yuan-wu in C. 1 566- 1 642) may answer, to a certain extent, the question asked in the beginning of this chapter, "What is Zen?" "It is presented right to your face, and at this moment the whole thing is handed over to you. For an intelligent fellow, one word should suffice to convince him of the truth of it, but even then, error has crept in. Much more so when it is committed to paper and ink or given up to wordy demonstration or to logical quibble, then it slips farther away from you. The great truth of Zen is possessed by everybody. Look into your own being and seek it not through others. Your own mind is above all forms; it is free and quiet and sufficient ; it eternally stamps itself in your six senses and four elements. In its light all is absorbed. Hush the dualism of subject and object, forget both, transcend the intellect, sever yourself from the understanding, and directly penetrate deep into the identity of the Buddha-mind; outside of this there are no realties. Therefore, when Bodhidharma came from the West, he simply declared, 'Directly pointing to one's own soul, my doctrine is unique, and is not hampered by the canonical teachings; it is the absolute transmission of the true seal.' Zen has nothing to do with letters, words, or sutras. It only requests you to grasp the point directly and therein to find your peaceful abode. When the mind is disturbed, the understanding is stirred, things are recognized, notions are entertained, ghostly spirits are conjured, and prejudices grow rampant. Zen will then forever be lost in the maze. "The wise Sekiso (Shih-shuang) said, 'Stop all your hankerings; let the mildew grow on your lips; make yourself like unto a perfect piece of immaculate silk; let your one thought be eternity; let yourself be like dead ashes, cold and lifeless; again let yourself be like an old censer in a deserted village shrine!' "Putting your simple faith in this, discipline yourself accordingly; let your body and mind be turned into an inanimate object of nature like a stone or a piece of wood; when a state of perfect motionlessness and unawareness is obtained all the signs of life will depart and also every trace of limitation will vanish. Not a single idea will disturb your consciousness, when lo! all of a sudden you will come to realize a light abounding in full gladness. It is like coming across a light in thick darkness; it is like receiving treasure in poverty. The four elements and the five aggregates are no more felt as burdens; so light, so easy, so free you are. Your very existence has been delivered from all limitations; you have become open, light, and transparent. You gain an illuminating insight into the very nature of things, which now appear to you as so many fairylike flowers having no graspable realities. Here is manifested the unsophisticated self which is the original face of your being; here is shown all bare the most beautiful landscape of your birthplace. There is but one straight passage opens and unobstructed through and through. This is so when you surrender all‚Äîyour body, your life, and all that belongs to your inmost self. This is where you gain peace, ease, non-doing, and inexpressible delight. All the sutras and sastras are no more than communications of this fact; all the sages, ancient as well as modern, have exhausted their ingenuity and imagination to no other purpose than to point the way to this. It is like unlocking the door to a treasury; when the entrance is once gained, every object coming into your view is yours, every opportunity that presents itself is available for your use; for are they not, however multitudinous, all possessions obtainable within the original being of yourself? Every treasure there is but waiting your pleasure and utilization. This is what is meant by 'Once gained, eternally gained, even unto the end of time.' Yet really there is nothing gained; what you have gained is no gain, and yet there is something truly gained in this." Imitate nature 
The significance of gardens for the Japanese comes from ancient religious beliefs and a deep respect for nature. This reverence is reflected by the design of the garden, which is supposed to look like the outside world, just on a smaller scale.
Japanese landscape designer Shiro Nakane restores historic gardens in Japan and creates new ones as well by following the traditional principles. He tells Architectural Digest the goal is ‚Äúnot to make a new nature but to make a copy of existing, desirable nature.‚Äù
Anything that would be found in nature can be integrated into the design. Nakane has drawn his designs from large geographical elements, such as Mount Fuji and Niagara Falls.
Symbolism
Since most Japanese gardens are found in smaller, enclosed spaces and their inspiration is much larger, it is crucial to shrink the size of the elements used.
Boulders become mountains and pools represent lakes. Most flat garden designs use gravel to symbolize water. The landscape is supposed to be a microcosm of the greater world beyond, so even bonsai trees can represent fully grown trees.
Nakane points out that even though the garden is supposed look natural, each detail is carefully considered.
‚ÄúRock arrangement is a bit like choreography,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIt can take an hour to twist and turn it until it‚Äôs placed right.‚Äù
Most Japanese gardens are enclosed with fences to further the concept of their being miniature worlds of their own. However, when the opportunity presents itself, outside views can be incorporated as well.
Having an open gate that can frame the desired vista connects the outside world with the inner reflective space of the garden. The borrowed view can be a distant mountain or a tree just beyond the fence. These natural features are incorporated as part of the garden‚Äôs design.
By integrating these outer elements, the ambiance and spirit of the location is captured.
Japanese gardening is an intricate process, and it is often said the design is never finished because, like nature, it is always changing.
Zen Buddhism is dedicated to the study of nature and humanity's place in the world. Japanese Zen gardens capture the philosophy of making a peaceful way. Attaining enlightenment by regular practice of Buddhist concepts may be doable, but for those who need a moment now and then in serene places to invigorate the soul, few places can match the setting of a Japanese garden. Within its boundaries, rock, stone, plants and water combine to still the mind.
Ishi
Mountains, Buddha and worship are suggested by the use of stones.
Rocks, or ishi, are foundational items in Japanese gardens. They typically represent mountains, but may also symbolize the figure of Buddha, or a gesture of strength and power. At many gardens, the entries are marked by a large stone, as a sign of welcome. Stones figure into the water elements and are sometimes used in forming paths. When water is not available, sand or small white pebbles are substituted to symbolize the space often held by water.
Mizu
Water is the purifying element but also can suggest space and time.
A vital element to life, mizu, or the water element, is found as ponds, streams, and waterfalls. Sometimes a small fountain designates the water element. Water is for purification and cleansing. When peering at or walking beside a pond in a Zen garden, the stillness and empty space are important for reflection in a literal sense. Meditation is the literal meaning of the word Zen, and water is a superb conduit for such practice. Falls have several symbolic overtures, and dripping indicates the passage of time.
Shokobutsu
The form and layout of plants must create a satisfying panorama.
Care is given in selecting the plantings, or shokobutsu, for a Japanese garden. Cherry trees, with their delicate pink flowers in spring, are a well-loved feature tree. Also often found are plum trees, different pines and bamboo. The sound of wind in bamboo and its motion teach the Zen principle of the "empty heart," providing strength through flexibility. The layout and groupings of plants must be subtle and pleasing, all year round.
Tenkeibutsu
Garden ornaments may include lamps, lanterns, frogs, fish or other statuary.
Lanterns are used as symbols of enlightenment. They are one form of tenkeibutsu, or ornamentation. Others might include frogs, basins and gates. Statues of the Buddha may be present, or of other deities, and a garden's teahouse might have a painting of carp or mandalas. Deeply traditional gardens will keep ornamentation to a minimum, and every item has a clear purpose.
Shakkei
The garden designers incorporated a distant view behind a teahouse.
To support the interconnectedness of all in existence, shakkei, or borrowing pre-existing scenery, is applied. The garden itself takes up a certain amount of land, but beyond its perimeter there might be hills or valleys, or something to frame with plants or structures within the garden's walls. The attentive garden designer will seek out how to blend with the near, far, high and low surroundings proportionately and gracefully.
Hashi
Bridges, or hashi, symbolize the journey between planes, and between worlds.
Hashi, or bridges, are constructed in the Zen garden to symbolize a person's journey between the planes of existence, the inner and outer, the multiple dimensions beyond and the place that lies between worlds. Man's unity with nature can be symbolized by his simple walking across a bridge to move from the world of humans into the wider world of all forms and beings. For the visitor to any Japanese garden, the bridge and all other elements present, may simply allow a moment of harmony and appreciation for what is.
One of the characteristics of the Japanese garden is the use of stone as a major component of landscapes created in a garden context. Since the very earliest dates of creating gardens in Japan (8th century), stones and their placement has been an important element. Given that the original inspiration for creating gardens came into Japan from China it is not great surprise, as stones have always held a dominant position in the Chinese garden culture. In both China and Japan gardens are recreations of landscape, or at least the attempt to create something of the perceived ‚Äòessence‚Äô of landscape. The term for landscape in Chinese is shansui, Â±±Ê∞¥ (sansui in Japanese); this is composed of two characters, the first reading ‚Äòmountain‚Äô, and the second ‚Äòwater‚Äô. Thus, the essence of landscape is encapsulated by the concept of ‚Äòmountains and water‚Äô. It is interesting to note in passing that the dominant element in the composition of Chinese landscape paintings are also mountains and mountain scenery. From a cursory glance it can easily be appreciated that the two principal components of a Japanese garden are indeed mountains (as represented by stones) and water (either real or symbolic).
Even today in the field of creating traditional gardens in Japan the setting of stones, ishigumi, Áü≥ÁµÑ, is regarded as a measure of the ultimate skill of a garden creator. Stones are accorded an almost reverential quality in the garden, and a great deal of care is taken in the selection and placement of stones. They are regarded as forming the essential skeleton of the garden, providing the garden layout with a fixed and subtle framework that will define the overall structure of the garden. Planting, that element of a garden so revered by Western garden makers, tends to be seen as adding flesh to the bones of a garden. In the East planting is complimentary to stone settings but ultimately subservient to the importance of stone arrangement. Perhaps this occurs because stones are perceived as adding a sense of permanence to a garden, whereas plants can be subject to an observable process of change and growth in the short term.
The types of stone used in Japanese gardens vary considerably in geological and mineral makeup. The choice of stones depends on availability and the intuitive sensibility of the garden creator. Stones with a provenience that may come from the status of previous owners are sought after and are considered highly desirable, also stones displaying eccentric forms are sometimes be used and can also be highly regarded.
Broadly, stones used in Japanese gardens can be classified into five basic types: 
Tall vertical; this is a stone taller than it is broad. It will stand upright, and very often be the focal point of a group. Can stand 0.9m (3‚Äô) or more from the ground.
Low vertical; much the same as above in essence, but a shorter piece. Generally, below 0.9m (3‚Äô) in height.
Inclining: this refers to stones that have a pronounced diagonal form. They may incline left to right or right to left. Inclining stones are often used as support pieces in triadic groups.
Reclining; this refers to stone that seem to arch from the ground in a more or less symmetrical manner, that is without a pronounced inclination to the left or right side.
Horizontal: this refers to stones that sit low and flat to the ground, with a top that has a defined horizontal plane. Stepping-stones are an example of these stones.
In assessing and choosing stones the garden creator needs to establish the inherent form of a stone, and in doing so gains an idea of how each stone is to be set. Every stone will have its own way to be arranged, this is determined by identifying the ‚Äòhead‚Äô or top of the stone, the ‚Äòface‚Äô or aspect of the stone deemed to have most aesthetic appeal, and the ‚Äòroot‚Äô or that portion of the stone to be set into the ground. In the Sakuteiki clear advice is given into stone setting: ‚ÄúWhen setting stones, first bring a number of different stones, both large and small, to the garden site and temporarily set them out on the ground‚Ä¶. Compare the various qualities of the stones and, keeping the overall garden plan in mind, pull the stones into place one by one.‚Äù        
Stones have a dynamic visual energy within them. That is, they are not regarded as being simply inert bodies occupying space. The overall shape of the stone, their texture and markings all give a sense of the energy that they are able to express. The stone illustrated below is a tall upright piece, looked at carefully it can be noted that particularly in the lower third of its bulk the graining of the stone has a sense of diagonal movement from right to left rising to the top left shoulder. Also looking at the overall bulk of the stone there is a subtle shift of weight that runs first diagonally from left to right, then shifts to run right to left to the top or head of the stone. These two ‚Äòmovements‚Äô within the stone are complimentary and give a rising feeling to the stone. The stone in question stands about 1.5 m (5 feet) from ground level and this bulk combined with its encapsulated sense of movement gives the stone a feeling of power and presence.
In the second stone illustrated, the overall shape of the stone is dominated by the rising shoulder running from right to left. In this stone the grain runs almost vertically from the ground upwards with light and darker minerals creating interesting vertical bands. Here the sharp contrast in the angle of the inclined shoulder and the vertical bands again complement one another giving an added strength to the stone‚Äôs visual appearance. This stone would not necessarily make a dominant stone in an arrangement, but would set well as a supporting stone, set to the right-hand side of a tall upright, so that the inclined shoulder points towards the top of an upright stone.
In a garden at Nanzen-ji temple, Kyoto can be found two fine examples of the use of reclining stones. The second stone (from the left) that is set low to the ground plane provides a visual link between the two larger stones set closer to the wall, it also has the function of emphasizing the bulk and height of the stones to the rear, as well as creating a sense of depth in the relationship between the three stones. Further to the right another reclining stone is also placed to the fore of the arrangement, which also functions in much the same way. A reclining stone does not draw particular attention to itself, but serves in a subordinate role, one that can be vital to an arrangement, nevertheless.
In creating a group of stones, it is usual to first set in place a stone that acts as a dominant stone in an arrangement. This will often be a tall upright stone set in the background of the overall plan, each subsequent stone set will then refer visually back to the dominant stone. In this way the entire arrangement is tied together into a logical and harmonious entirety. Stones are rarely set-in isolation, but most commonly arranged in triadic compositions. This is true of both individual stones creating a group, as well as groups of stones set across the entire scheme. In both cases it is important that individual stones and groups relate to one another in a harmonious manner. In Japan this spatial arrangement is commonly found in all the visual arts (such as painting and flower arrangement) and is known as ≈çshakei. The three elements of ≈çshakei are referred to as Heaven, Man and Earth: Heaven being the vertical dimension, Man the diagonal, and Earth the horizontal. Heaven expresses a quality of aspiration, Man the quality of dynamism and Earth the quality of stability. Vertical and horizontal forces are ‚Äòfixed‚Äô in the sense that they require the completion of the triad‚Äôs third element to provide a sense of implied dynamic movement. Where only two of the three elements are present then the fundamental opposition of the forces involved acts to cancel each other out, and the result can be a state of stasis or lack of movement. Most stone groups are composed with an uneven number of elements, the numbers three, five and seven being the most common. The reason for this is that even numbers are considered to be static, whereas uneven numbers are seen to hold a greater potential for dynamic energy or have a potential to imply change.
A powerful expression of the triadic arrangement can be found at Zuiho-in temple (part of the Daitoku-ji complex, Kyoto) created in 1961 by Mirei Shigemori. The stone arrangement of the south garden also well illustrates the Japanese aesthetic preference for asymmetrical composition. The center of the arrangement is located to the extreme right-hand side, where a powerful group of five stones are located; at the rear of which a tall upright stands supported by two further upright stones descending in height and rising to sharp peaks. The stones are set close and the angles of the flanks of the stones blend seamlessly into one another providing a visual continuity that rising through the triad to the top (and beyond) of the dominant stone. To further enhance the grouping Shigemori set two further stones in close attendance; to the right is a lower inclining stone which features a peak that reflects the Dominant stone, its right-hand side flank falling in line with a diagonal line that again continues to the peak of the Dominant stone. To provide a sense of stability to the group on the left side is a lower reclining stone set to lean into the main group, again the outline of this the fifth stone in the group perfectly aligns with the diagonal line running up from left to right that cuts across the verticality of the Dominant stone. The result is a powerful and dynamic arrangement that seems to rear out of the earth, yet it carries a sense of great stability and of being deeply rooted in the earth from which it springs. Shigemori adds depth to this section of the garden by placing another group, this time of three stones, at a lower level in the raked gravel. The Dominant stone of this triad has an angled top that moves the line of connectivity towards the upper five grouping, its sheer flat face very strongly vertical. This is tempered by a low, squat, upright with a slightly rounded top that nestles at the base on the left side anchoring the vertical movement. The whole group is then further anchored by the presence of a very low upright with a flatten top set to the right side. Setting this subordinate stone, a little apart from the Dominant opens up a gap between what are otherwise closely set stones that in fact overlap one another. The flatten top of the stone combined with the spatial separation gives the sense of a spiraling movement that rises from this the smallest of the stones right through the entire group, allowing a smooth transition from the very lowest to the very highest.
Shigemori further emphasizes triadic element of the entire garden by extending the composition out along the left diagonal plane where it finishes and is held by a low upright stone set by itself in the heavily raked gravel. Between the main axis of the arrangement and this final stone he places several other stones to further reflect the dynamic movements and rhythms. Given that the garden is in a relatively confined space it carries a wonderful sense of flow, which manages complexity and simplicity, movement and harmony. Seen from the verandah the entire garden arrangement is further enhanced by the strong lines imparted by the boundary wall and clipped hedges. Here, these horizontal lines give the space a passive backcloth which throws the stone arrangements into greater relief, whilst at the same time providing a steady, soothing undercurrent to contain the movements. Shigemori‚Äôs garden creation manages to be both contemporary whilst also being respectful to traditions of artistic composition that have deep, ancient, roots in Eastern aesthetics.
Whilst in a garden such as at Zuiho-in Shigeimori employs tight alignments between the forms of the stones to create triadic relationships, in a garden such as Ryoan-ji (created perhaps in the late 15th century), the relationships are more subtlety executed and less obviously defined. Here there is a greater emphasis on the overall disposition of one to another of the five groups of placements that make up the composition. The open spaces between the stone groups clearly have a greater role than simply providing a sense of differentiation and definition. Whilst appearing to be casual enough, the disposition of the stones within their respective groupings, and also between the groups themselves, is clearly the result of a great deal of sensitive aesthetic consideration. The stones themselves have little inherent drama in themselves, yet the overall effect is perhaps even more compelling and persuasive. A sense of mystery, of intrigue, stalks the garden like no other. Perhaps this is what draws the thousands of visitors to the garden. Stones used in such a way in a garden setting seem to act as centers of energy. Emanating from the stones seems to be some mystic energy that is contained within them; perhaps stones continue to radiate in some subtle manner the traces of the forces by which rock was created in the first place. Given that they are forces of energy of such a level of immensity that, ultimately, defy definition or comprehension.
That stones may contain powers or energetic forces was clearly recognized in Sakuteiki, where an important section of the text is taken up with detailing a variety of taboos concerning stone placements and selection. In particular the text warns of the misplacement of stones, or the inappropriate placement of stones, and the dire results that can result from violating taboos.
‚ÄúUsing a stone that once stood upright in a reclining manner or using a reclining stone as a standing stone. If this is done, that stone will definitely become a Phantom stone (reiseki, or spirit stone) and be cursed.‚Äù
‚ÄúDo not set a stone that it falls directly in line with the columns of the building. Violate this taboo and even one‚Äôs descendants will suffer, evil occurrences will abound, and all one‚Äôs wealth will be lost.‚Äù
‚ÄúHirotaka has said the setting of stones should not be done thoughtlessly. There are many taboos with regard to the setting of stones. Violate just one of them, it is said, and something terrible will befall the master of the house, and his household too, will not continue for long.‚Äù
Such expressions reveal much of the attitude and perception people of that era had towards garden elements, one which we may consider today as being eccentric, rather than anthropocentric. Stones, and plants, in a garden were recognized as having an energetic force or in Japanese (Ê∞ó). Shinto, the native religion of Japan, acknowledged all things, animate as well as inanimate, as having a life force that needed to be respected. Thus, to perceive stones as being capable of influencing human affairs would have been quite natural, ultimately all of Nature was to be revered as a divine expression. Rather than being superseded by the establishment of Buddhism, this ancient geomantic view was overlain by an expansion of expression. Hence by the Middle Ages in Japan the practice of naming of garden stones became a common practice. Naming is a way of both animating a quality, but also projecting qualities on to an object. The names for stones were derived from Buddhist, Taoist, Shinto and Confucian sources, as well as stones being named for their function and for scenic effects they purported to hold.
Therefore, we have a three stone arrangement known as Sansonseki (‚ÄòThree Deities stones‚Äô), which evokes the presence of the Buddhist trinity (the interpretation of which deities varies widely, but may include Dainichi Nyorai Â§ßÊó•Â¶ÇÊù•, Amida Butsu ÈòøÂº•ÈôÄ‰ªè and Kannon Ë¶≥Èü≥). The Sakuteiki notes: ‚ÄúIf a Buddhist Trinity (sansonseki) is placed in the southwest, there will be no curse, neither will malevolent spirits be able to enter.‚Äù One may speculate from this that the purpose of sansonseki in the garden was to provide a protection to the household. Another Buddhist deity that frequently is associated with gardens is Fud≈ç My≈ç≈ç ‰∏çÂãïÊòéÁéã, this protective figure is associated with waterfalls possibly through his adoption by the mountain priests of the shugend≈ç sect of esoteric Buddhism whose rigorous training in mountains such as Mt Heiei, include purification by standing under waterfalls. A large flat-topped rock is often referred to as a zazenseki, or a meditation stone, as it may well have been placed for precisely that purpose and can be found in several gardens, such as at Saih≈ç-ji, the ‚ÄòMoss temple‚Äô near Kyoto.
'Rock of the Spirit Kings' (shinn≈çseki), 'Never Aging Rock' (fur≈çseki), 'Rock of Ten Thousand Eons' (mang≈çseki), 'Bufo Rock' (gamaishi), all these are names derived from Taoist iconography and have associations with the notion of paradisial islands.
''Master Rock (shugy≈çseki), 'Attendant Rock' (shinseki), 'Yin/Yang Stones (iny≈çseki), 'Status Rock' (kanseki); all these names have Confucian significance, where social status and order is a prime concern.
Shinto references are more vague to deduce but given the animistic content of Shinto iconography stones that refer to animals probably have some significance, such as 'Duck‚Äôs Abode stone' (kamoi ishi), and 'Flying Birds rocks' (toritobi ishi). Stones found in natural settings known as iwakura have definite associations with Shinto. These are regarded as being places where deities either abide or places at which they may have some communication with humans. Usually, iwakura are very large stones and are delineated by a harness of rice straw rope draped around them. Very occasionally such stones are found in the precincts of shrines and temples, through garden use is not at all common.
Amid examples of names for functional stones are:
Takisoe ishi (ÊªùÊ∑ªÁü≥) 'Cascade supporting stones'; these are tall stones placed either side of the Cascade stone over which water flows
Teishuseki (‰∫≠‰∏ª)Áü≥ 'Host‚Äôs stone'; this would be a broad flat stone placed so to give a prime view over the garden.
Teshoku ishi (ÊâãÁá≠)Áü≥ 'Lamp stone'; a flat-topped low stone places to the left of a water basin for evening or night tea ceremonies.
Yut≈ç seki(ÊπØÊ°∂Áü≥) 'Warm water basin stone', a low flat-topped stone set to the right side of a water basin, it holds a basin of warm water for winter or cold season tea ceremony.
Sekimori ishi (Èñ¢ÂÆàÁü≥) 'Barrier stone'; a convention of the Tea garden, a fist sized stone wrapped with sisal which may be placed on a steppingstone, it indicates that particular path is closed and guides a visitor along an alternative path.
Kutsunugi ishi (Ê≤ìËÑ±Áü≥) 'Shoe leaving stone'; a long low flat-topped stone at the entry point to a building where outdoor shoes are left before entering.
Scenic stones are stones that are intended to evoke landscape imagery in the imagination of the viewer. The names describe well their symbolic role and use:
Namiuke ishi Êµ™ÂèóÁü≥ 'Wave dividing stone'; a stone placed in a stream that is intended to split the flow, often creating a small pool of sound.
Sancho seki Â±±È†ÇÁü≥ 'Summit stone': a stone set on an earth mound or hill in the garden.
Sawatobi ishi Ê≤¢È£õÁü≥ 'Water crossing stones'; steppingstones set across a stream or shallow pond.
Shumisen ishiÈ†àÂº•Â±±Áü≥ 'Mt. Shumisen stone'; a tall upright stone that evokes the mystic Buddhist mountain, also is generally read as a paradisial symbol.
Funatsuki ishi ËàπÁùÄÁü≥ 'Boat Landing stone'; flat stones set into the bank of a pond from which one steps onto dry land after disembarking. Boating was a popular activity in the larger stroll gardens. Such stones are sometimes used in gardens where the pond is too small to use for boating, but their presence still would evoke the idea of boating.
D≈çjiseki Á´•Â≠êÁü≥ 'Children stones'; usually a scattering of small stones offset from a prominent stone, the effect is of a scattering of children running about. The pattern of the layout of such stones would be carefree and intentionally unstructured.
It should not be taken from the above notes on names that a garden is required to be composed of named stones, there are many gardens whose stone placements have not been designated any ‚Äòmeaning‚Äô. Gardens where the stones are arranged purely for visual and/or spatial purposes. Undoubtedly in the Edo period in Japan (1603-1867), the use of named stones in gardens became very popular, almost formulaic. The intention of this was generally to evoke associations in the mind of the viewer thereby increasing the level of engagement that the viewer could have with the garden. In garden manuals complied about that period and earlier stones are certainly designated names, but there was no standard for this, knowledge of garden making techniques was subject to guild like limitations. One had to be an initiate into the practice to know of certain things, and teaching related to garden making was passed from generation to generation orally, much as it still is into the 21st century.
A successful stone arrangement is one that recognizes that the primary material that the garden creator works with is not simply the outward form of the stone but its inner energetic patterns. A stone today has come to appear a certain way through the unique configuration of the forces of its creation as stone, weathering, patina and also its history. This process has taken millions of years to achieve, it is easy to overlook and take this for granted, but it is something that is important the stone arranger or garden creator needs to bear in mind. Perception and a profound sensitivity to the materials with which one works, is a vital element in the creation of any artwork. Blending a group of stones together into a coherent whole, whilst allowing space and time for the imagination of the viewer to be part of that process of recognition and comprehension, is something that is absorbed as part of the training of a Japanese garden creator. This principal extends right through the garden, through the use of planting, the relationship between buildings and the garden and by the use of land-shaping and the relationship between the garden and its external environment too. Thus, the practice of setting stones becomes an art form in itself, employing aesthetic concerns, as much as techniques concerned with rhythm, space, pattern and any symbolic content that may be projected through the work. The garden is not a formulaic construction and it draws deeply on the sensitivity of its creator in order to work well, that is, for the garden to reach and communicate with the viewer the garden creator has to find the very qualities he or she wishes to project outwardly with themselves. The movement outwards are also a movement inwards.
Above all, in practice the selection, use and setting of stones becomes an intuitive practice in experienced garden creators. The Sakuteiki is clear that the stone setter should ‚Äòfollow the requesting mood of the stone‚Äô, and this is probably the most important element of the use of stones in the Japanese garden. It is not so much the ego of the garden creator that is of principal importance, but rather there is a process of sublimation of the creator‚Äôs ego to recognize the primacy of the materials themselves. The garden creator trains his or her eye and heart to see the materials as they are, and to be able to use them as such. Interpreting the requirements of site, client and materials is the key to successful garden making. Nowhere is this more apparent and important in the setting of stones that has been noted above is one of the key practices in the creation of Japanese gardens. It has always been so, and no doubt will continue to be so.
Japanese gardens are generally classified according to the nature of the terrain, either tsuki-yama (‚Äúartificial hills‚Äù) or hira-niwa (‚Äúlevel ground‚Äù), each having particular features. Tsuki-yama consists of hills and ponds, and hira-niwa consists of flat ground designed to represent a valley or moor; tsuki-yama may include a portion laid out as hira-niwa. Each type may, furthermore, be treated in any one of the three degrees of elaboration mentioned. Hill gardens as a rule include a stream and a pond of real water, but there is a special variation, the kare-sansui (dried-up landscape) style, in which rocks are composed to suggest a waterfall and its basin and, for a winding stream or a pond, gravel or sand is used to symbolize water or to suggest seasonally dried-up terrain.
Japanese gardens are characterized by the waterfall, of which there are ten or more different arrangements; the spring and stream to which it gives rise; the lake; hills, built up from earth excavated from the basin for the lake; islands; bridges of many varieties; and the natural guardian stones. The selection and effective distribution of the stones are a prime consideration in garden design. After endless experiments and deep pondering, the best and most subtle compositions were handed down by means of drawings. A studied irregularity in the arrangement of steppingstones is a noteworthy feature of the chanoyu garden, where beauty and use are combined.
In modern Japanese gardens, flowers are few and evergreens popular. Simplicity, restraint, and consistency are sought rather than gaiety, showiness, or the obvious variations of the seasons. Evergreen foliage is preferred to the changing aspect of deciduous trees, although maples and a few others are used. As in the case of stones, trees must be distributed in the garden in harmony with their natural origin and habit of growth. Wells, decorative and useful alike, stone water basins in endless variety, stone lanterns and figures, pagodas, arbors, and summer houses are the most characteristic garden furnishings. Together with gateways and fences‚Äîparticularly the widely varying sode-gaki (‚Äúsleeve fences‚Äù) attached to the side of a house to screen certain portions‚Äîthese elements harmonize the natural beauty of the garden with the architectural features of the house.
In the course of history, the objective standpoint in garden making gave way to the subjective impulse. Various philosophic principles and religious doctrines were applied to the making of gardens, not so much to interpret those principles and doctrines as to rationalize the aesthetics of garden design. Natural rocks distributed to illustrate familiar philosophic principles and even beliefs of all sorts still continue to some extent to influence the general design of the garden. The aim is to bring humanity close to nature and every conceivable means may be employed to realize it. Some master garden designers represented landscapes of China and Japan in miniature. They planned the garden and planted trees to give the illusion of the view extending over and beyond its immediate confines, but at the same time they designed it to be a secluded sylvan retreat, great ingenuity being displayed in both directions. In some instances, only a few stones in the narrow strip of ground suffice to suggest a great expanse of landscape, included as background.
Sen Riky≈´, in his garden at Sakai, obstructed the open view of the sea so that only when guests stooped at the stone basin to perform ablutions prior to entering the cha-shitsu did they catch an unexpected glimpse through the trees of shimmering sea, thus suddenly being made to realize the relation of the dipperful of water lifted from the basin to the vast expanse of sea and of themselves to the universe.
Throughout history the Japanese have tried to emphasize in their gardens the charm of restraint; beauty is so concealed that it may be discovered individually, thus providing a thrill of joy to the soul like that which comes from doing a good deed in stealth. In its ideal at least, the Japanese garden, which always has been part of the home, is by no means merely an arrangement of beautiful places. It aims at satisfying a human craving for the natural and, by supplying peace and repose, at offering a retreat in which one can find spiritual recreation and sustenance.
tones‚Äîlarge and small‚Äîare a major component of most Japanese gardens and must have been important from the very beginnings of garden design. As Takei's and Keane's recent translation of the Sakuteiki points out, the opening line of that oldest of Japanese garden manuals equates the creation of gardens with the setting of stones. The "meaning" and the aesthetic appeal of garden stones have been the subjects of much analysis by the students of these gardens, but it is a controversial topic. There can be little doubt that the use of stones and the reverence shown them have roots in Shinto belief, but the exact nature of stone worship in prehistoric Japan can only be surmised. That the selection and placing of stones in the historic period has a spiritual component cannot be denied, however, as that responsibility often fell to the priestly caste. The Sakuteiki specifically mentions the secrets of rock-placing and associates them with the priest En no Enjari. Indeed, stones and the placing of stones are the major concern in garden design according to that ancient text, particularly since the poor placement of stones would lead to misfortune and illness. 
The art and craft of the Japanese garden continues to thrive today after well over 1,300 years in Japan and for the last 150 years in various points west and east. It is difficult to define one reason for the almost instant endearment of these beautiful spaces, but for me, it has always been the Japanese garden‚Äôs ability to capture the essence of the greater natural world as well as its ability to adapt to almost any type of site and topography. Most of us are only familiar with the Japanese garden in public-park settings, and while beautiful, these gardens would likely be far out of our range in terms of cost‚Äîand perhaps scale‚Äîto even be given a second thought as an option for our own homes. There are, however, elements of design within nearly all Japanese gardens that can be integrated into a non-Japanese garden with great success. The key is not to paint a Japanese face on your garden in an effort to make it look or feel authentically Japanese. Take cues, instead, from Japanese-gardening techniques to evoke the peace and tranquility that these gardens inspire. To do this, we will need to look closely at some of the elements of traditional Japanese-garden design.
Japan is one of the few areas in the world that places such strong cultural significance on the seasons as they relate to daily life and the feelings and moods that they evoke. It‚Äôs easy to understand, then, the importance of the seasons within the garden. The best gardens in Japan, for example, would rarely, if ever, feature a Japanese-maple cultivar with red leaves during the growing season. The seasonal color change is what is desirable.
Spring is the period of rebirth, so deciduous plants that bloom or go directly into leaf are a desired feature. The goal is a brief, subdued color display that is appropriate to the season. Summer
in the Japanese garden is the season of green, rather than the riotous display of flowering shrubs and perennials often seen in western gardens. In the days before air-conditioning, nothing was more satisfying than retreating to the green of the summer garden with, perhaps, the sound of trickling water to cool you down.
Fall gives us a chance to look back, and the drop of colorful leaves signals the year‚Äôs end. Winter is a time of rest for the garden, but it is also a time to see the scaffold of the leafless trees and the way that snow dresses the evergreen plants.
Choose small, deli¬≠cate, pale-colored flowers
in spring.
Opt for plants with healthy foliage in summer, rather than ones with lots of flowers.
Feature distinct foliage-color changes and intriguing structure in fall and winter.
Perhaps the main thing that converted me to using the principles of Japanese gardens is the way that the Japanese home and garden are seamlessly integrated. This is largely due to Japanese homes featuring floor-to-ceiling views of the garden, which effectively brings the outside into the house. While many of our homes feature windows that can only be looked through while standing, others have homes with sliding doors and floor plans not unlike the traditional Japanese home.
That said, when the garden is intended or has the potential to be viewed from a fixed location, such as inside the house, there shouldn‚Äôt be distraction or clutter in between to diminish the experience. Avoid planting right outside a window. Not every inch needs to be filled with plants or stone groupings. There needs to be empty space‚Äîsuch as a lawn area, a sea of gravel, or a pond‚Äîthat gives the viewer a sense of depth.
Also, numerous techniques allow us also to trick the eye into believing that the garden is wider or deeper than it is. A long, narrow space, for example, might use sparse planting in the foreground with increasingly heavier plantings in the middle and back to constrict the rectangular shape of the site and make the viewer look to just one distant vantage point.
Selecting the best possible materials is important in constructing any garden. Become familiar with the materials available to you before you start. High-quality materials can be expensive, and it is better to wait until they fit your budget than to compromise and go with inferior materials just to get the job done. Consulting with a professional, as well, might be well worth the investment. When it comes to plants, consider species that are well adapted to your area, even though they might not be what you would immediately consider typical for a Japanese garden. Likewise, take into account the maintenance that a plant will require in the beginning to save you headaches‚Äîand an overgrown mess‚Äîlater. A well-maintained garden of marginal design will far outshine the best-designed garden that is given no care.
We have all heard the phrase ‚Äútoo much of a good thing.‚Äù Overpowering a garden with a poor architectural choice, ostentatious stone groupings, or too many specimen trees gives the viewer a sense of uneasiness, which is the opposite of our goal. Lanterns and pagodas, for example, have a place in some gardens, but if they are used as the element to define the space as a Japanese garden, it would be better to start over and find a path that did not require their use for credibility. Directional signs and plant labels should also be avoided because they are unnecessary and clutter the garden.
Japanese gardens are not collections of Japanese plants but, rather, arrangements of plants and materials that evoke landscape scenery. When we try to create an area that makes us think of the mountains, a meadow, or the seashore, we use the plants that commonly grow there. To create a scene where no one part over¬≠powers the rest, avoid mixing wildly contrasting foliage textures and colors in favor of a more harmonious blend of plants.
The well-conceived garden should have landforms, plantings, and pathways that relate in scale to the size of the human body. This makes the viewer feel familiar with the site conditions and, thus, more comfortable. Japanese gardens are created on this human scale, sometimes by using techniques of abstract representation or distilling the essence of the scenic parts of the natural world to impart their mood to the garden. When using large stones to evoke the feeling of mountains or a water course, for example, it is important to use a variety of sizes and shapes to effectively replicate what we see in nature. Similarly, plants must be selected and maintained at a variety of sizes and shapes in an effort to offer a feeling of old and new. This keeps the view from becoming stagnant with plantings that have grown to a similar size and offer little variation for the eye to move up and down naturally through the composition.
If you consider the variously arranged garden stones and contour of the land as the skeleton of the garden, then it is equally important to consider the ideal size of the attending plantings; that‚Äôs because the stones and mounds do not get any bigger, while the plantings do. The solution in Japan has been to prune all plants in the garden to keep them in proportion to the layout of the rest of the garden, but this can be accomplished with careful plant choices, as well.
It is rare to see large shade trees in a garden in Japan, simply because they are out of proportion with the rest of the garden. These trees are reserved for parks and temple gardens where their size is better in scale with the surrounding space and the archi¬≠tecture. Large shade trees are a common feature of American gardens, however, and often a necessity for summer shade. A way to keep these trees is to use additional plantings of smaller trees that transition the height of the trees back to the ground plane so that they aren‚Äôt disproportionately larger than everything else in the garden.
Go easy on contrast and color
Color and contrast are wonderful for making an exciting garden, but the power of a Japanese garden comes from its ability to evoke a sense of calmness from the visitor. This vignette has very few bright colors‚Äîand even those are kept small and far away.
Stay in scale
When the size of the elements of a garden are too large, a person feels
insignificant; when they are too small, one can feel clumsy and awkward. By keeping this path just, the right width for a person to walk on and keeping the plantings down to a size where one can interact with them, this vignette has a scale that contributes to the peaceful mood of the space.
Feel free to have nothing
Gardeners often have the impulse to put a plant into any open space that they see. But the empty spaces between plants gives everything room to create its own impact. This vignette makes use of gravel and low ground covers to allow everything to breathe.
Zen aims at the perfection of personhood. To this end, sitting meditation called ‚Äúza-zen‚Äù is employed as a foundational method of prƒÅxis across the different schools of this Buddha-Way‚Äîwhich is not an ideology, but a way of living. Through za-zen the Zen practitioner attempts to embody non-discriminatory wisdom vis-√†-vis the meditational experience known as ‚Äúsatori‚Äù (enlightenment). A process of discovering wisdom culminates, among other things, in the experiential apprehension of the equality of all thing-events.
The most distinguishing feature of this school of the Buddha-Way is its contention that wisdom, accompanied by compassion, is expressed in the everyday lifeworld when associating with one‚Äôs self, other people, and nature. The everyday lifeworld for most people is an evanescent transforming stage in which living is consumed, philosophically speaking, by an either-or, ego-logical, dualistic paradigm of thinking with its attendant psychological states such as stress and anxiety. Zen demands an overcoming of this paradigm in practice by achieving a holistic and non dualistic perspective in cognition, so that the Zen practitioner can celebrate, with stillness of mind, a life directed toward the concrete thing-events of everyday life and nature. For this reason, the Zen practitioner is required to embody freedom expressive of the original human nature, called ‚Äúbuddha-nature.‚Äù
Generally speaking, Zen cherishes simplicity and straightforwardness in grasping reality and acting on it ‚Äúhere and now,‚Äù for it believes that a thing-event that is immediately presenting before one‚Äôs eyes or under one‚Äôs foot is no other than an expression of suchness. In other words the thing-event is disclosing its primordial mode of being such that it is as it is. It also understands a specificity of the thing-event to be a recapitulation of the whole; parts and the whole are to be lived in an inseparable relationship through an exercise of nondiscriminatory wisdom, without prioritizing the visible over the invisible, the explicit over the implicit, or vice versa.
As such, Zen maintains a stance of ‚Äúnot one‚Äù and ‚Äúnot two,‚Äù that is ‚Äúa position less position,‚Äù where ‚Äúnot two‚Äù means negating the dualistic stance that divides the whole into two parts, while ‚Äúnot one‚Äù means negating the non dualistic stance occurring when the Zen practitioner dwells in the whole as one, while suspending judgment in meditation. The free, bilateral movement between ‚Äúnot one‚Äù and ‚Äúnot two‚Äù characterizes Zen‚Äôs achievement of a personhood with a third perspective that cannot, however, be confined to either dualism or non-dualism, neither ‚Äúnot one‚Äù nor ‚Äúnot two‚Äù.
The designation of this school of the Buddha-Way as Zen, which means sitting meditation, is derived from a transliteration of the Chinese word Ch√°n. Because the Chinese term is in turn a transliteration of the Sanskrit term dhyƒÅna, however, Zen owes its historical origin to early Indian Buddhism, where a deepened state of meditation, called samƒÅdhi, was singled out as one of the three components of study a Buddhist was required to master, the other two being an observation of ethical precepts (sƒ´la) and an embodiment of nondiscriminatory wisdom (praj√±ƒÅ). Meditation was picked as the name for this school because the historical Buddha achieved enlightenment (nirvƒÅna) through the practice of meditation. In the context of Zen Buddhism, the perfection of nondiscriminatory wisdom (Jpn.: hannya haramitsu; Skrt.: praj√±ƒÅpƒÅramitƒÅ) designates practical, experiential knowledge. Only secondarily and derivatively does it mean theoretical, intellectual knowledge. This is, Zen explains, because theoretical knowledge is a form of ‚Äúlanguage game‚Äù (Jpn.: keron; Skrt.: prapa√±ca), i.e., discrimination through the use of language, constructed as it is at least in part on distinction-making. Zen believes that theoretical reference ultimately carries no existential meaning for emancipating a human being from his or her predicaments, for it maintains that discriminatory knowledge of any kind is delusory/illusory in nature. To this effect it holds that it is through a practical transformation of the psychophysiological constitution of one‚Äôs being that one prepares for embodying nondiscriminatory wisdom. This preparation involves the training of the whole person and is called ‚Äúself-cultivation‚Äù (shugy≈ç) in Japanese. It is a practical method of correcting the modality of one‚Äôs mind by correcting the modality of one‚Äôs body, in which practice (prƒÅxis) is given precedence over theory (the≈çria) (Yuasa, 1987).
There are basically two methods utilized in meditation practice in Zen Buddhism to assist the practitioner to reach the above-mentioned goals, together with a simple breathing exercise known as ‚Äúobservation of breath count‚Äù (s≈´sokukan); one is the k≈çan method and the other is called ‚Äújust sitting‚Äù (shikan taza), a form of ‚Äúsingle act samƒÅdhi.‚Äù For example, the former is employed mainly by the Rinzai school of Zen Buddhism, while the latter by the S≈çt≈ç school; they are the two main schools of this form of the Buddha-Way still flourishing today in Japan. In the Rinzai school, the k≈çan method is devised to assist the practitioner to become a ‚ÄúZen person‚Äù (Kasulis, 1981) who fully embodies both wisdom and compassion. A k≈çan is formulated like a riddle or puzzle and is designed in such a way that intellectual reasoning alone cannot solve it without breaking through the barrier of ego-consciousness by driving it to its limit. This is, Zen believes, because ego-consciousness is fortified by the shield of a dualistic conceptual paradigm with all its attendant presuppositions and conditions. The ego-consciousness of a given cultural and historical milieu accepts that paradigm to be true in order to live a life anchored in the everyday standpoint.
According to Hakuin (1685‚Äì1768), who systematized k≈çans, there are formally seventeen hundred cases of k≈çans, and if sub-questions are added to them, a total number of cases comprising the system would be roughly three thousand. The Zen practitioner of the Rinzai school is required to pass them all in a private consultation with a Zen master who checks the practitioner‚Äôs state of mind before he or she is granted a seal of transmission. This transmission is said to occur ‚Äúonly from a Buddha to a[nother] Buddha‚Äù (yuibutsu yobutsu).
K≈çans are accordingly grouped into five categories in a most fully developed system: the first group is designed for reaching li (suchness) (richi) or the body of truth (hosshin), i.e., an enlightenment experience; the second group for a linguistic articulation (gensen) of meditational experiences in order to master the skillful use of language; the third group for those k≈çans truly difficult to pass (nant≈ç); the fourth group for the practitioner to make an insight of k≈çan experiences pertinent to daily life (kikan) in order to embody a middle-way in which the practitioner won‚Äôt be steeped either in the state of meditation or the activity of daily life; and the fifth group for going beyond the state of buddhahood by erasing all traces of enlightenment in order to achieve a traceless enlightenment (k≈çj≈ç).
The Rinzai school summarizes this process of self-cultivation in four mottoes: ‚Äúbeing a special transmission outside of the scriptures,‚Äù ‚Äúhaving no dependence on words and letters,‚Äù ‚Äúpointing directly into [one‚Äôs] human mind,‚Äù and ‚Äúseeing into [one‚Äôs] nature to become a buddha.‚Äù (See, for examples, The Gateless Gate and The Blue Cliff Record.) While the first two phrases point to the fact of discovering an extra-linguistic reality that naturally opens up in meditational experience and of articulating it linguistically in the ‚Äúbest‚Äù way according to the capacity of an individual practitioner, the last two phrases indicate a concretization of the original or inherent enlightenment (hongaku) in the Zen practitioner, where the original enlightenment means that human beings are innately endowed with a possibility of becoming a Buddha.
On the other hand, the S≈çt≈ç school, of which D≈çgen (1200‚Äì54) is the founder, does not rely on an elaborate k≈çan system to learn to become a Zen person, but instead follows a method called ‚Äújust sitting‚Äù (shikan taza). It refers to a single-minded, diligent practice where the qualifying term ‚Äújust‚Äù means the practice of meditation without any intervention of ego-logical interest, concern, or desire, so that the practice remains undefiled. This is a method of meditation predicated on the belief that the Zen practitioner engages in the practice in the midst of the original enlightenment. Or to characterize it by using D≈çgen‚Äôs phrase, it is a method of ‚Äúpractice-realization.‚Äù By hyphenating practice and realization, the following implications are suggested: meditation is not a means to an end, i.e., a means to realization, and thereby D≈çgen closes a dualistic gap, for example, between potentiality and actuality, between before and after. Accordingly, he collapses the distinction between ‚Äúacquired enlightenment‚Äù (shikaku) and ‚Äúoriginal enlightenment,‚Äù (hongaku) where the ‚Äúacquired‚Äù enlightenment means an enlightenment that is realized through the practice of meditation as a means. With this collapsing, the S≈çt≈ç School holds that practice and realization are non-dual in relation to each other; they are ‚Äúnot two.‚Äù
According to the S≈çt≈ç school, the meditational practice, when it is seen as a process of discovery, is a deepening process of becoming aware of the original enlightenment with an expansion of its corresponding experiential correlates and horizons, and it is for this reason called the school of ‚Äúgradual enlightenment‚Äù or ‚Äúsilent illumination.‚Äù On the other hand, the Rinzai school is called the school of ‚Äúsudden enlightenment,‚Äù because it does not recognize a process leading to enlightenment (satori) as something worthy of a special attention; what counts is an experience of satori only. Even though there is the above difference in approach between Rinzai and S≈çt≈ç schools, the outcome is the same for both insofar as the embodiment of wisdom and compassion is concerned. This is because they both follow the same practice of sitting meditation. Whatever differences there are between the practitioners of the two schools in regard to the linguistic articulation of their meditational experience, they arise from individual practitioners‚Äô personalities, dispositions, intellectual capacities, and/or linguistic abilities.
Once the bodily posture and the breathing are adjusted, the practitioner next learns to adjust the mind. This means that the practitioner consciously moves to enter a state of meditation. In so doing, the practitioner learns to disengage him- or herself from the concerns of daily life. That is to say, one tries to stop the operation of the conscious mind. However, if one tries to stop the mind by using one‚Äôs mind, the mind which is trying to stop itself is still operative. In other words, it is practically impossible to stop the mind by using the mind. Instead, Zen tries to accomplish this by the immobile bodily posture and the breathing exercise. In this connection, it will be informative to know how the practitioner experiences breathing as he or she deepens meditation.

We can identify three basic stages: initially the practitioner can hear the audible sound of the in-coming and out-going breaths. This is rough and ‚Äúgross‚Äù breathing. This is followed by the second stage in which he or she can feel the pathway of the in-coming and out-going breaths. Breathing at this point becomes ‚Äúsubtle‚Äù in that there will no longer be audible sound of the breaths but simply a stream of life-energy. In the third stage there is no more feeling of the in-coming and out-going breaths. When this occurs, the practitioner can settle into a deeper meditational state. Also, it is significant to note that as the practitioner enters a deeper state of meditation, the interval between inhalation and exhalation is prolonged, i.e., the retention of breath is prolonged, as the reduction of breathing activities occurs.
Meditation trains one to sit face-to-face with one‚Äôs self, while creating a psychological isolation from the external world. With this, one enters into an internal world of psychƒì. As the practitioner attempts to enter the world of psychƒì, various things start surfacing in the field of the practitioner‚Äôs meditative awareness. These are mostly things of concern that have occupied the practitioner in the history of his or her life, or things the practitioner has consciously suppressed for various reasons. Initially, the practitioner experiences recent desires, anxieties, concerns, ideas, and images that have surfaced in his or her daily life. A psychological reason that the practitioner experiences these various things is due in part to the fact the practitioner has lowered the level of conscious activity, by assuming the meditation posture, and doing the breathing exercise. This mechanism is the same as when one has a dream at night. When the level of consciousness is lowered, the suppressive power of ego-consciousness weakens, and consequently the autonomous activity of the unconscious begins to surface.
However, these desires, images and ideas are distractions insofar as meditation is concerned. This is because in meditation you must learn to focus your awareness on one thing. One must learn just to observe without getting involved in them. That is, one must learn to dis-identify oneself with them. In the process of deepening meditation, one can roughly identify three distinct stages: the stage of concentration, the stage of meditation, and the stage of absorption. In the stage of concentration, the practitioner concentrates, for example on the lower abdomen, establishing a dualistic relationship between the practitioner who is concentrating and the lower abdomen that is the focus of concentration. This dualistic relationship is broken gradually as the practitioner moves into the stage of meditation. The activity of the ego-consciousness is gradually lessened, and the barriers it sets up for itself are gradually removed. When the practitioner enters the stage of absorption (samƒÅdhi), the dualistic framing of the mind will be removed such that the mind starts structuring itself non-dualistically. There will be no separation or distancing between an object of the mind and the activity of the mind itself.
As the practitioner repeats this process over a long period of time, he or she will come to experience a state in which no-thing appears. Zen uses the phrase ‚Äúno-mind‚Äù to designate this state. No-mind does not mean a mindless state. Nor does it mean that there is no mind. It means that there is no conscious activity of the mind that is associated with ego-consciousness in the everyday standpoint. In other word, no-mind is a free mind that is not delimited by ideas, desires, and images. No-mind is a state of mind in which there is neither a superimposition of ideas nor a psychological projection. That is, no-mind is a practical transcendence from the everyday mind, without departing from the everydayness of the world.
As may be surmised from the foregoing explanation on Zen‚Äôs methodological stance, it is perhaps best to understand Zen as an anti-philosophy if the term ‚Äúphilosophy‚Äù is taken to mean the establishment of ‚Äúthe kingdom of reason.‚Äù That enterprise has been launched as an intellectual effort of the most brilliant minds in Europe since the modern period to find new ways to ground our conception of human nature, something beyond the traditional Christian dogmas that had incorporated classic Aristotelian and Platonic views. Since then, various Western philosophers have attempted to capture human nature with this goal in mind by using ego-consciousness as a starting point as well as a destination in philosophy. For example, human nature has been characterized in terms of ego-consciousness (Descartes), Reason, Personality, Transcendental Subjectivity (Kant and Husserl), Life (Dilthey), Existence (Existential philosophers such as Kierkegaard, Jaspers and Sartre) and Dasein (Heidegger). (See Yuasa 2003, 160‚Äì61.)
By contrast, Zen‚Äôs stance of ‚Äúanti-philosophy‚Äù maintains among other things that reason in its discursive use is incapable of knowing and understanding in toto what reality is, for example, what human beings are and what their relation to nature is. For this reason, Zen contends that physical nature and human nature must be sought in an experiential dimension practically trans-descending, and hence transcending, the standpoint of ego-consciousness. That is to say, it must go beyond ‚Äúthe one‚Äù and ‚Äúthe two,‚Äù as both of these stances are prone to generate a one-sided stance, and hence incomplete world-view. Instead, they must be sought in the depths of one‚Äôs psycheÃÑ and beyond. For example, Zen Master Seigen (Chin; Qƒ´ngyu√°ng, 660‚Äì740) expresses the process of self-cultivation to the effect that: ‚ÄúBefore the practice, mountains are mountains, during the practice, mountains are not mountains, and after the realization, mountains are [truly] mountains [again].‚Äù In the meditational process of discovery then, Zen moves from an ordinary, commonsensical standpoint to an extraordinary standpoint, and with this transformation returns to the everyday lifeworld, wherein no Aristotelian either-or logic is accepted as the standard for knowing and understanding reality. As a result, paradoxes, contradictions, and even what appears to be utter nonsense abound in Zen literature. The k≈çan method mentioned above exemplifies this point. To cite just one such example: ‚Äúthe river does not flow but the bridge does.‚Äù If one attempts to understand that by relying on an Aristotelian either-or logic as the standard for understanding, one will be under the impression that this expression is nonsensical or meaningless.
As may be surmised, by relying on the above-mentioned methodological stance, Zen Buddhism has produced an understanding of reality‚Äîone‚Äôs own self, nature with life activities and human nature‚Äîquite different from those offered by Western philosophy. Therefore, we can say that Zen is an anti-philosophy in that it is not a systematization of knowledge built on the use of a discursive mode of reasoning anchored in the (alleged) certainty or transparency of ego-consciousness, one that follows an epistemological paradigm built on an ego-logical, either-or, dualistic mode of knowing. Yet, it upholds something like a philosophy that springs forth through a reflective restatement of the practice, though this ‚Äúupholding‚Äù must be understood with a proviso that it maintains, as mentioned in the foregoing, a ‚Äúpositionless position.‚Äù (Abe, 1989.) This is because Zen abhors ‚Äúholding onto‚Äù anything, which Zen considers a case of ‚Äúself-binding without a rope.‚Äù Such a self-binding would trap the Zen practitioner into a mode of attachment that is the source of suffering and, consequently, would disrupt the sense of embodied freedom it cherishes.
Logically speaking, Zen explains that ‚Äútwo‚Äù things arise because the everyday standpoint stipulates the above-mention epistemological paradigm as the standard for cognizing the whole, however the whole may be construed (Nagatomo, 2000, 213‚Äì44). This logic thinks it reasonable to divide the whole into two parts when knowing or understanding reality. That is, when this logic is applied to the whole, it compels the user of this logic to choose, reasonably in the mind of the user, one part, while disregarding the other part(s) as irrelevant or meaningless. It prioritizes one part at the expense of the other part(s), while celebrating the exclusion. In so doing, it looks to the explicit while becoming oblivious to the fact that the implicit equally exists as a supporting ground for the explicit, where the explicit is something ‚Äúobvious‚Äù to the senses and the rational mind. It champions one-sidedness in cognition and judgment as the supreme form of knowing and understanding reality. However, Zen thinks that this prioritization, this exclusion, violates a cardinal principle of knowing, for knowledge of anything demands an understanding of the whole. Either-or logic fails on this account. Moreover, it contends that when this logic attempts to understand the whole, it theoretically reduces the other to the one that is judged to be true and/or real. For example, if one maintains that the mind is real, one disregards the body as unreal, yielding an idealist position. On the other hand, if one thinks the body is real, it disposes of the mind in the same way, favoring materialism as true and real, which is presupposed, for example, by natural science. Either position commits itself to reductionism. Here, questioning this practice and the consequences it entails, Zen instead speaks of mind-body oneness, an holistic perspective, as it abhors one-sidedness. However, it warns that as soon as ‚Äúone‚Äù is contrasted with ‚Äútwo‚Äù in a discourse, it is no longer genuine and authentic, because once it is objectified linguistically or reflectively, it slips into being an idea, an abstraction.
Zen maintains that the situation created by assuming this epistemological paradigm is not ideal, or real, for that matter. Hence, Zen says ‚Äúnot two.‚Äù ‚ÄúNot two‚Äù is in part a recommendation for experientially achieving oneness through the practice of meditation, informing the holder of the ‚Äútwo‚Äù of the narrow and limited scope of her/his understanding, where the idea of oneness may, for now, be conceived at many levels, starting with the physical, the subtle, and the samƒÅdhic. Generally speaking then, Zen takes ‚Äúnot two‚Äù to designate a negation of any ‚Äútwo‚Äù things that are affirmed to be individually real, in which the perspective that realizes the place or domain where two things occur is ignored. The dualistic standpoint also ignores the logical fact that any ‚Äútwo‚Äù things cannot be individually one because for one to be, it must be dependent on, and interconnects with, the other one. An either-or logic ignores this interdependence, in part because it operates within a conceptual and linguistic space with the assumption that there is no temporal change. This assumption enables a thinker to establish the law of identity, namely that A remains the same with itself, or identical with itself. With this recommendation, Zen maintains that mind and body, I and others, I and nature ought to be experienced as one by those who remain in the everyday standpoint. To express this idea, Zen states that ‚ÄúHeaven and Earth share the same root, and I and the myriad things are one (-body).‚Äù It demands an holistic perspective necessary to achieve knowledge that is genuine and authentic. Otherwise, Zen fears that the practitioner will fall into one-sidedness, in which the knowledge claim ends up being partial, imbalanced, and even prejudiced. D≈çgen captures this by stating: ‚ÄúWhen one side is illuminated, the other side remains in darkness.‚Äù To characterize the dualistic, either-or, ego-logical standpoint by borrowing Nietzsche‚Äôs phrase, Zen would say that it is ‚Äúhuman, and all too human.‚Äù
Care must be exercised in understanding the meaning of ‚Äúnot‚Äù in the phrase ‚Äúnot two‚Äù however. Zen insists that the ‚Äúnot‚Äù primarily refers to an existential, practical negation of the ‚ÄúI,‚Äù which the practitioner achieves by ‚Äúup-rooting the ego-consciousness,‚Äù and in turn yields, by implication, a logical negation as well. This is because Zen thinks the practitioner cannot achieve this negation simply by following either-or logic, or for that matter by following the intellectual process of reasoning, because both logic and reasoning intrinsically involve two things, for example, the thinker and the thought. With either-or logic a mere logical negation involves an infinite regress in negating the ‚ÄúI‚Äù; one who negates the ‚ÄúI‚Äù retains the affirmative act of holding ‚ÄúI‚Äù in the mind as that which negates. And when the ‚ÄúI‚Äù further attempts to negate this affirming act, there still remains an ‚ÄúI‚Äù who negates it and the process goes on ad infinitum. For this reason, Zen recommends the practitioner to ‚Äúforget the ‚ÄòI‚Äù when engaging oneself in any action, be it a mind-act, bodily-act, or speech-act, as is seen for example in both D≈çgen and Takuan (1573‚Äì1645).
To recapitulate the idea of the Zen meaning of negation as expressed in ‚Äúnot two,‚Äù Zen sees its self-cultivation as involving a thoroughgoing negation of the ‚ÄúI‚Äù to the point that no problem, either existential or psychological, entrenched in the ‚ÄúI‚Äù remains. Hence, we have Rinzai‚Äôs phrase: ‚Äúif you becomes a master in any place, wherever you stand is true.‚Äù (Iriya, 1989, 70) Truth for Zen is not merely a matter of formulating or uttering a propositional statement, but rather embodying it by becoming, to use his phrase again, a ‚Äútrue person of no rank,‚Äù (ibid, 20) where ‚Äúno rank‚Äù designates the freedom of standing beyond social or linguistic conventions such that a Zen person can use convention freely. Equally important is Zen‚Äôs contention that both logical and intellectual methods are abstract, for they become divorced from the actual reality of day-to-day existence. In other words, in the eyes of Zen, these methods lack consideration for the concreteness and immediacy of lived experience. This is because the theoretical standpoint defines the human being who observes things of nature from the outside, which can be characterized, by using Yuasa‚Äôs phrase, as a ‚Äúbeing-outside-of-nature.‚Äù Instead, Zen maintains that the human being must be understood as a being rooted in nature. To use Yuasa‚Äôs phrase again, it is a ‚Äúbeing-in-nature.‚Äù This point is well portrayed in Zen‚Äôs landscape paintings wherein a human figure occupies the space of a mere dot in a vast natural scenery (Yuasa, 2003, 160‚Äì1).
The experiential dimension in which Zen‚Äôs ‚Äúnothing‚Äù becomes understandable refers to a quiescent state of meditation in which is arrested the activity of an individual practitioner‚Äôs ego-consciousness that functions in a close correlation with his or her body. Upon reaching such a meditational state, the Zen practitioner comes to experience an event generally known as ‚Äúseeing into one‚Äôs nature‚Äù (kensh≈ç), an initial satori experience. Although this phrase may on the surface suggest a dualistic state, namely that there is something that is called ‚Äúnature,‚Äù which the Zen practitioner comes to see as an object. This interpretation occurs because ‚Äúseeing‚Äùis understood to be an intentional activity of the practitioner. However, this ‚Äúseeing‚Äù has a sense of becoming visible such that ‚Äúone‚Äôs own nature‚Äù emerges in the meditative awareness when the activity of ego-consciousness is arrested. Once this experience occurs, the practitioner gradually turns the seeing into one‚Äôs nature (according to the interpretation vis-√†-vis the acquired enlightenment), or the practitioner realizes that one‚Äôs nature is seeing (according to the interpretation vis-√†-vis the original enlightenment). The Zen tradition interprets ‚Äúnature‚Äù to be ‚Äúbuddha-nature,‚Äù i.e., the possibility to be awakened from fundamental ignorance. That is to say, to become a Buddha, and the way of its being is designated by the term tathatƒÅ, suchness or a thing-event‚Äôs being such that it is showing its primordial mode of being. When this aspect of knowledge is emphasized, Zen calls it ‚Äúoriginal‚Äù or ‚Äúnatural‚Äù knowledge. In this connection, it contends that the ‚Äúseeing‚Äù is ‚Äúnot two,‚Äù i.e., it is non-dualistic in nature.
To illustrate an experiential basis for the above observation, we may cite another example, namely D≈çgen‚Äôs enlightenment experience. This will aid the reader to catch a glimpse of an experiential meaning of ‚Äúnot two,‚Äù for it is descriptive of the experience itself. He expresses it as ‚Äúdropping off the body and the mind‚Äù (shinjin datsuraku). (In order to get an idea of this experience from a contemporary point-of-view, or from outside of Zen tradition, one may also consider out-of-body experiences.) The experience of ‚Äúdropping off the body and the mind‚Äù informs us that the dualistic relationship between the mind and the body has disappeared in meditational awareness and by implication ‚ÄúI‚Äù and others, and ‚ÄúI‚Äù and nature. Hence they are ‚Äúnot two.‚Äù If the distinction has disappeared, it implies that the Zen practitioner is thrown into a non-dualistic domain of experience. It points to a practical transcendence from the everyday either-or, ego-logical, dualistic standpoint.
In light of the outer-inner distinction Zen interprets the non-dualistic experience to mean that the distinction has been epistemologically collapsed, as it arises in such a way to respond to the dualistic perspective from which the outer and the inner worlds appeared. It understands this collapsing of the distinction then to be the meaning of ‚Äúnot two,‚Äù from which an holistic perspective emerges. Conceptually, Zen takes this holistic perspective to mean the de-substantialization and de-ontologization of any two polar concepts, such as one and many, being and non-being, universal and particular, absolute and relative, transcendence and immanence, and birth and death. Zen‚Äôs observation is that each of the polar terms is non-dualistically related to each of the other polar terms such that they are connected with, interdependent on, and relative to, each other for their being and meaning. They are thrown into a holistic context of an interdependent causal series. And for this series to be operative, Zen maintains, following NƒÅgƒÅrjuna, that each of these terms that enters the relationship is empty of self-nature, where self-nature means a power to generate itself on its own without dependence on anything. For if thing-events designated by these terms are endowed with self-nature, they cannot enter into the series; what enters such a series is only an accidental attribute or property. According to the substantialistic or essentialistic ontology, nothing can really change. For example, criminals who want to correct their criminal behavior cannot change themselves if being a criminal is the essential characterization of their being. This would pose an insurmountable challenge, if not impossibility, to a correction officer at a prison. Or, for that matter, anyone who wants to correct one‚Äôs own psychological characteristic or tendency, particularly if it happens to be pathological, cannot succeed in such self-correction if it is an essential characterization of one‚Äôs being.
In order to give a still more concrete sense of what Zen-seeing is like, we now return to the question of how Zen understands the experiential meaning of ‚Äúseeing into one‚Äôs nature.‚Äù Zen‚Äôs contention is that the bottomless ground is that which non-dualistically ‚Äúsees‚Äù when the practitioner experiences the state of nothing (or no-thought and no-image). How then does Zen articulate this ‚Äúseeing‚Äù? This question points to an examination of the epistemic structure of how knowledge operates in Zen experience. For this purpose, the following Zen dialogue between Jinne and Ch≈çsetsu concerning ‚Äúno-thought‚Äù is illuminating. Although it is lengthy, we quote it in full in order to provide a sense of how a Zen dialogue unfolds:
The disciple asks: Then what is it [i.e., no-thought]?
The master replies: It is nothing like ‚Äúwhat is.‚Äù Therefore, we can not explain ‚Äúno-thought.‚Äù The reason why I am speaking about it now is because you have asked about it. If you hadn‚Äôt asked about it, there would be no need to explain it. Suppose that there is a clear, transparent mirror. If it does not face a thing, no image is reflected in it. To say that it mirrors an image means that because it faces something, it just mirrors its image.
The disciple asks: If it does not face any thing, is there or is there not a reflection in the mirror?
The master replies: That the mirror reflects a thing means that it always mirrors regardless of whether it is facing or not facing a thing.
The disciple asks: If there is no image and since you do not give an explanation, how can all beings and nonbeings become an issue? Now when you say that it always mirrors, how does it mirror?
The master replies: When I say that the mirror always mirrors, it is because a clear, transparent mirror possesses an original nature as its essential activity of always mirroring things. Analogously, people‚Äôs mind is originally undefiled, and naturally possesses a superb light of wisdom that illuminates the perfect world of nirvƒÅna.
The disciple asks: Insofar as people‚Äôs minds are originally like that, when do people get it?
The master replies: It just sees nothing.
The disciple asks: When it is nothing, what can it see?
The master replies: Seeing is not like something you can call a thing.
The disciple asks: If it is not like anything one can call a thing, what does it see?
The master replies: it sees no-thing. That is the true seeing. It always sees.
(Yanagita, 1974, 132‚Äì3.)
Unlike most Zen dialogues that are often enigmatic and puzzling to people outside the tradition, this dialogue provides an explanation that indicates what ‚Äúseeing‚Äù is like in Zen experience. This ‚Äúseeing‚Äù is said to be ‚Äúseeing nothing or no-thing,‚Äù and Jinne speaks of it by appealing to the analogy of a mirror, although he makes a disclaimer that it cannot adequately be explained in words. To get a glimpse of what he means by ‚Äúseeing,‚Äù it is helpful to take note of the following points regarding this analogy. Jinne conceives of a mirror in terms of two modalities: the mirror in and of itself and the mirror as it engages an object other than itself. It is important to keep in mind that both are understood in light of their activity. He characterizes the ‚Äúoriginal nature‚Äù of the mirror in and of itself as being ‚Äúclear, transparent‚Äù (or ‚Äúundefiled‚Äù), wherein it is said to always mirror. ‚ÄúOriginal‚Äù means that it is not contingent on experience, while ‚Äúalways‚Äù refers to the mirror‚Äôs ceaseless activity of mirroring. Whether ‚Äúthere is‚Äù or ‚Äúthere is not‚Äù a specific object to mirror is a contingent matter for the mirror in and of itself. What makes a mirror what it is is its activity of always mirroring, and when considered in and of itself, it possesses no specific image to mirror. There is no characteristic to it and hence no image appearing in it, i.e., ‚Äúno-thought‚Äù or ‚Äúno-image.‚Äù This is the meaning of ‚Äúno-thing or nothing‚Äù in the phrase ‚Äúseeing no-thing or nothing.‚Äù In other words, the mirror is turned into nothing, or to use the earlier phrase, the bottomless ground is nothing except, epistemologically speaking, its capacity to mirror, and even this capacity is rendered ‚Äúnothing‚Äù when it is in no use.
Zen explains the fact that the mirror ‚Äújust sees no-thing or nothing‚Äù when its act of seeing is mobilized in ‚Äúfacing‚Äù a thing. The adverb ‚Äújust‚Äù is crucial. ‚ÄúJust‚Äù here means without discrimination, without superimposition, without projection, or in short, without positing an ego-consciousness as that which sees. In phenomenological terms, there is no thetic positing in this kind of seeing. Zen maintains that these characterizations obtain because the Zen practitioner ‚Äúkicked through the bottom of the bucket,‚Äù a practical transcendence. In other words, Zen‚Äôs contention is that there is no determination whatsoever in the mirror‚Äôs activity of ‚Äújust seeing.‚Äù That there is no determination means to Zen that because the bottomless ground is nothing, it does not impose form on things that are mirrored. When these qualifications are taken together, Zen interprets ‚Äújust seeing no-thing or nothing‚Äù to mean seeing or mirroring things without discrimination, that is, with a sense of equality. When a mirror, for example, reflects an image of a beautiful object, it does not make any discriminatory value judgment that it is beautiful. And neither does it make any discriminatory value judgment when it mirrors an ugly object. It mirrors thing-events as they are. That is, the mirror does not take any stance of likes and dislikes; it does not take a stance of ‚Äúfor‚Äù or ‚Äúagainst.‚Äù It is non-egological in mirroring each thing equally.
Moreover, Zen observes that the nature of the mirror is such that it does not change due to the kind of object it mirrors. For example, it does not increase or decrease in size in virtue of the fact that it mirrors an object. (Bankei, for example, expresses it as the ‚Äúunborn.‚Äù) It remains as it is in its original nature of always mirroring, which highlights the fact that it is clear and transparent. Because equality is the characteristic of this seeing, Zen speaks of the activity of this seeing as nondiscriminatory. Yet, because an object is mirrored as object, whether beautiful or ugly, Zen considers the act of mirroring to be a ‚Äúdiscernment.‚Äù Therefore, Zen characterizes the ‚Äúseeing‚Äù in ‚Äúseeing no-thing or nothing‚Äù in its act-aspect as a discernment vis-√†-vis nondiscrimination (mubunbetsu no funbetsu). This, Jinne says, is ‚Äútrue seeing,‚Äù which is non-discriminatory wisdom (praj√±ƒÅ). Through this mirror analogy, Zen wants to point out what the minds of people are like in their original nature and activity. Zen summarizes all of the above characteristics of seeing by employing a simple phrase: ‚Äúmotion in stillness‚Äù (seich≈´ no d≈ç). However, an objection may be raised against Zen‚Äôs holistic, non-dualistic ‚Äúseeing‚Äù or ‚Äúmirroring,‚Äù namely, the objection that if there is something that is mirrored, does that not still imply a dualistic epistemological structure? Zen would respond that this objection ignores the fact that the ground of seeing is the bottomless ground that is nothing. What appears against mirror qua nothing is just an object. In such a seeing, the object alone shines forth. Hence, it is characterized, to use Nishida‚Äôs terminology, as ‚Äúseeing without a seer.‚Äù (See the entry on The Kyoto School, Sect. 3.3.) Below, we will explore further the structure of how things appear in Zen.
Although it may sound paradoxical, Zen maintains that this ground is also a fount of creativity. Because there is no determination in the ground, it is pregnant with many possibilities or meanings to be realized. Zen maintains, via the influences from philosophical Daoism, that this creativity is in the same order as that of nature, for the practitioner reaches the original source prior to the distinction between the outer world and the inner world. (Hence, Zen understands, as was mentioned in the foregoing, the human being to be ‚Äúa being-in-nature.‚Äù)
It often uses the phrase ‚Äúno-mind‚Äù (mushin) to generally designate the above experiential dimension. However, Zen does not mean it to be a mindless state, much less losing the mind. Nor does it mean a disappearance of the mind. Rather it designates a dimension of experience in which the ego-logically discriminatory activity of the mind disappears. This may be illustrated in terms of seeing things that occurs in a deep state of meditative absorption, where ‚Äúseeing‚Äù means becoming visible as mentioned above. Zen adepts are said to acquire a power of meditation (Jpn.: j≈çriki), which is related to abilities like clairvoyance, clairaudience, and retrocognition. These abilities coincide with those of two of the three night-watches on the night of historical Buddha‚Äôs enlightenment experience. Once such a power becomes available to the meditators, they intentionally focus on seeing whatever they want to see. This is an activity of ego-consciousness, but after settling into a deeper state of absorption, the person‚Äôs ego-conscious activity ceases and an image appears from the unconscious in response to the meditator‚Äôs intention. This is because the unconscious has an autonomous activity that works independent of conscious will. This occurs once the meditator eliminates or lessens the oppositional and conflicting relationship between the consciousness and unconscious. If, however, the meditator tries to see an image by relying on his or her ego-consciousness, the image which has surfaced in the field of meditative awareness immediately disappears, because the meditator slips back into a dualistic state from the non-dualistic state. The meditator must remain in a non-dualistic state in order to see what appears in the field of meditative awareness.
Philosophically speaking, we can characterize this experiential event that the Zen practitioner trans-descends into, and hence transcends, the ego-logically discriminatory activity of the mind. Zen contends that this arises due to adhering to ‚Äúname-form‚Äù (Jpn.: my≈çshiki; Skrt.: nƒÅmar≈´pa). This transcendence results in a rejection of the belief that there is a reality corresponding to a name, or generally that there is a reality corresponding to a linguistic activity. Through the state of no-mind, Zen observes that each individual thing that is mirrored is recognized for the first time to be individual qua the individual with a sense of equality that is due to other individual things.
In spite of, or rather because of, the above-mentioned experiential dimension of Zen-seeing, Zen insists that the Zen practitioner plant his or her feet in the everydayness of ‚Äúhere and now.‚Äù In this respect, Zen philosophically advocates a position of ‚Äúnot one,‚Äù where ‚Äúone‚Äù here means remaining in the state of meditative absorption. Otherwise, it fears that if the practitioner remains in the stillness of meditation, while suspending judgment on action, it falls into one-sidedness, a source of prejudice and misunderstanding of reality. How then does Zen understand ‚Äúhere and now‚Äù? In this connection, one may reasonably ask: ‚Äúhow far and wide is ‚Äòhere‚Äô and how long is ‚Äònow,‚Äô‚Äù when Zen speaks of ‚Äúhere and now.‚Äù Are they each limited by a present perceptual experience? In the case of ‚Äúnow,‚Äù for example, is it an internal phenomenon of consciousness that allows the practitioner to experience time sometimes as a ‚Äúmemory‚Äù (or retention) and some other times as ‚Äúanticipation‚Äù (or ‚Äúprotention‚Äù) in the ever flowing stream of ‚Äúpresent‚Äù (e.g., as described by St. Augustine, Husserl and Merleau-Ponty)? And in the case of ‚Äúhere,‚Äù is it delimited by the practitioner‚Äôs spatial range of perception within the sensory field, situating the Zen practitioner as the point of reference? (There is in both cases a suggestion of involvement of the autonomous activity of the unconscious, of which Zen demands we must stand outside.) Zen‚Äôs response to both of these questions is a resounding ‚ÄúYes!‚Äù and ‚ÄúNo!‚Äù however contradictory it may sound. ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù because the practitioner, while living, cannot depart from the ‚Äúhere and now,‚Äù because he or she is incarnate, in which case time and space is always experienced as ‚Äúhere and now.‚Äù ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù insofar as the perceptual model implies an ego-logical ‚Äúhuman, all too human‚Äù stance (Nietzsche) with its attendant limitations, even though Zen does not exclude this model as long as it is not delimited by the dualistic, either-or ego-logical perspective. In the everyday human world that is ‚Äúhere and now,‚Äù Zen maintains that ‚Äúriddhi and [its] wondrous activity all shoulder water and carry firewood‚Äù where ‚Äúriddhi‚Äù refers to a power that naturally becomes available to the practitioner through the practice of meditation.
The idea is that an element of architecture (for example, a doorway, or a building edge, even a window mullion) or a distinctive landscape feature (prominent tree, existing pool, property boundary) can ‚Äúgenerate‚Äù an imaginary line that helps connect and organize the design. For example, in laying out one backyard, I projected the lines of its building addition into the garden space and then aligned the swimming pool and wooden walkway with those lines. The result is orderly and cohesive, even after being softened with planting. ‚ÄúA regulating line,‚Äù wrote the great architect (and theoretician) Le Corbusier, is an assurance against capriciousness. It confers on the work the quality of rhythm. The choice of a regulating line fixes the fundamental geometry of the work.
The decking on a different project in Pacific Palisades, CA, creates a regulating line that is parallel to the plane create by the gray wall of the house in the upper right of the image. Another regulating line is created by the edge of the pool running parallel to the glass window on the home. These lines intersect at the base of the tree. The law of significant enclosure says that we feel enclosed when the vertical edge of a space is at least one-third the length of the horizontal space we‚Äôre inhabiting.
One is the Golden Ratio which is a ratio of proportion that‚Äôs been observed in everything from the Great Pyramids at Giza to the Greek Parthenon and has been used throughout history as a guide to a pleasing sense of balance and order. The practical application that I make of the Golden Ratio involves its sibling, the Golden Rectangle, in which the ratio of the short side to the long side is equal to the ratio of the long side to the sum of both sides (a/b = b/a+b)‚Äîyou probably didn‚Äôt know that landscape architects had to learn math. Numerically, the Golden Rectangle ratio is close to 1: 1.6, a proportion I regularly use to lay out terraces, patios, arbors, and lawns. The raised beds in my vegetable garden are 5 by 8 feet. It‚Äôs a rectangular proportion that always looks good‚Äîthey don‚Äôt call it golden for nothing!
It is a humbling experience when you first encounter an authentic Japanese Zen Garden. Many of the original gardens in Kyoto are over one-thousand years old, dating back to the Japanese Heian Period, when the philosophy of Zen Buddhism was at its intellectual height. These Zen gardens fall within two large categories ‚Äì sansui  (mountain and water) or karesansui (dry garden) styles . Traditionally most people identify the stereotypical Zen garden as the karesansui  style, but in fact there are several historically important Zen gardens that have lush greenery, deciduous shade trees, and flowing water features much like our traditional American Gardens ‚Äì the gardens of Ginkakuji  and Saihoji  are two such examples.
Stones carry a great deal of importance within the Japanese Zen philosophy. They represent a permanence and history within the Japanese culture and are an essential addition to the Zen garden. Most Japanese gardens were designed as reflections of mysterious and natural landscapes that surrounded the capital city of Kyoto. The backdrop of Mt. Hiei and the northern range of mountains that encompassed the city gave historical designers inspiration to work from. Groupings of stones were meant to mimic the wonderful topographical changes they witnessed from afar.
The stones were often placed in a grouping of three ‚Äì a triad. Zen gardens had specific geomantic rules about the names of the stones and their placement, which can be copied and utilized in your own garden.  The dominant stone is shuseki ‚Äì the initial central stone. It is the focal point of the triadic grouping and should be the tallest of the three. It should be chosen based on its sculptural characteristics. Unique features such as striations, fissures, and markings on the stone are all prized for a shuseki.
The second stone, the fukuseki, should be a short, wide, and squat stone that acts as an anchor of the grouping. The stone should be relatively flat or rounded, without too many undulations or crevices. Unlike the focal stone, the fukuseki is placed to add breadth to the display and complement the height and sculptural quality of the shuseki.
The third stone is the kyakuseki. It is the subordinate of the grouping and is utilized to complete and fill-out the design. The stone should be smaller than the fukuseki in both height and width, ideally being flat and unornamented.  If necessary, additional stones may be added similar to the kyakuseki to create a five or seven pair grouping. However, the triadic placement is the most common.

Plants, such as grasses or mosses, can be inter-planted between the stones but are unnecessary ‚Äì a simple gravel or earthen base is also perfectly acceptable.
The pathway that runs through a garden, or around it, is often the last thing that a true horticulturalist cares about; however, for the Japanese designer it is of the utmost importance. The pathway dictates a specific itinerary or journey that the visitor completes.  Walking along well planned pathway can provide the passerby with a story of reflection in which small moments of awakening arise. This is keeping with the true Zen Buddhist philosophy.
One design strategy that can be implemented to recreate a meaningful pathway is called the ‚Äúprayer card path‚Äù based on the Japanese Ema, which were small wooden plaques in which Buddhist worshipers would write inscriptions to communicate wishes to unseen spirits. The prayer card path is a reflection of this, using small flat wide stones of various sizes interspersed at specific moments along a pathway.
The entire pathway should not be made in the image of a prayer card, but rather you should identify one or two special moments or views within your garden where you wish people to stop and reflect. It is at these places where you can lay these rectangular flat stones as a means to visually communicate the importance of that location. For the visitor, they will see the notable difference in the pathway, and most likely search for the meaning behind it ‚Äì a common Zen practice.
A very common strategy found within Japanese Zen gardens is the shakkei, roughly translating to mean a ‚Äúborrowed view‚Äù or ‚Äúborrowed scene‚Äù.  A central tenet of the Zen garden was enclosure. The purpose of the garden was to recreate a miniaturized world in which an idealized landscape is created. Therefore, it was essential to close off and protect the garden by walls or fences. Almost all of the historically significant Zen gardens are enclosed in a similar way, including Ryoanii, Joju-in, and Entsuji.
Although the walls and barriers exist as a means of enclosure, the Zen tradition often identifies key corridors of views to create a sense of promise or awe for the visitor. The corridors, called shakkei, borrow scenery from other areas beyond the confines of the garden itself. In traditional Japanese culture, these borrowed views would be taken from the mountainous landscapes which surround the city of Kyoto, but the principles can still be implemented in your own personal landscape.
One technique is to plant a flowering specimen tree or grouping of desirable shrubs in an area beyond the boundary of your defined garden. Then identify a specific place, or places, within the garden, that is intended to view this feature from. This can be a specific marking along a path, or a dedicated bench or stone. The intention is to highlight the created view from within the garden, even though the beauty lies beyond it.  You can also combine this with the triadic stone grouping  ‚Äì in which the grouping can designate the location to view from, or be located beyond the garden as an element to view.
As you can see, there are several small changes you can make in your existing garden or yard to add the flair of a traditional Zen planting. The history, culture, and philosophy of Zen gardens is unique and complex, with a multitude of variations and styles a gardener can borrow from.

Carefully raked sand or gravel with precisely placed rocks are the main parts of a zen garden. Sand raked into a round, spiral or rippled pattern represents the sea. Place rocks on top of the sand to make a soothing pattern. You can add plants, but keep them to a minimum and use low, spreading plants instead of upright ones. The result should encourage introspection and meditation. The symbolism of the stones in a zen garden is one of the most important design elements. Upright or vertical stones can be used to represent trees, while flat, horizontal stones represent water. Arching stones represent fire. Try different layouts to see what natural elements the design calls to mind. A zen garden can also contain a simple bridge or path and lanterns made of rock or stone. These features add a sense of distance, and you can use them as a focal point to aid meditation. The term ‚Äúshakkei‚Äù means borrowed landscape, and it refers to the practice of using surrounding landscape to make the garden appear to extend beyond its boundaries. A zen garden should not contain a pond or be near a body of water.
Concealment. Hidden places, winding paths and artful placement of elements like walls or bamboo can create a sense of mystery and encourage guests to walk further to see what is around the corner. To achieve this aesthetic, consider surrounding plants and trees, and notice how the space selected hides and reveals itself from different angles throughout a garden or room.
In outdoor areas, lining up medium to large rocks and adding an organic shape, like a small pond or a meandering stream, can create separation while making a space appear bigger and less specifically formed.  Established trees or shrubs can be incorporated into a Zen garden by adding a circle of gravel three or four feet from the trunk to create a small island from which the tree appears to have sprouted.
Asymmetry. Instead of straight lines or perfect circles, the Zen aesthetic lends itself to unexpected, flowing organic shapes: natural, but not too wild. While some Zen gardens include a water feature, it's more common to represent this element with gravel raked into wave-like patterns. In an outdoor space, gravel can be 4-5 inches deep to help prevent weeds from intruding; inside, 3 inches deep is sufficient. Planters with flowing, organic shapes, like our Spiral Unique Planter, can also create this aesthetic.
A Zen garden strives to be an idealized, artistic representation of nature. In a traditional zen garden, large, upright rocks represent mountains or islands arranged within the gravel sea. Weathered, beaten rocks, perhaps with crags and pits notched into the surface, represent nature as ancient and timeless. Flanking the largest rock with a few smaller ones can give the impression of a mountain surrounded by foothills.
Borrowed Scenery. A Zen garden incorporates the surroundings beyond the immediate landscape and how it influences the whole scene. Situating a Zen garden to make use of neighboring trees, an interesting building, or hilly view beyond a garden, patio, or window. The architecture of nearby buildings, particularly the one housing the Zen garden, should also be considered when creating this design.
Huo Hsi (1020 to 1090 A.D.), one of China's great landscape painters, was an astute observer of how the moods of nature affect the human senses. "The din of the dusty world and the locked-in-ness of human habitations are what human nature habitually abhors," he wrote, "whilemist and the haunting spirits of the mountains are what human nature seeks, and yet can rarely find. How delightful then to have a landscape painted by a skilled hand! Without leaving the room, at once we find ourselves among the streams and ravines" Japanese garden design, like landscape painting and haiku, developed out of this yearning to experience our essential oneness with nature. For 14 centuries this landscape art has been responding to the beauty of nature and to human culture.
There are two quite different paths to authenticity in Japanese gardening. The quickest way to tell them apart is to consider two key aspects of the design process‚Äîthe sources of inspiration and the choice of materials. The first and most facile of the two approaches is a literal interpretation of the tradition‚Äîthe lower path. Here, creative response takes a back seat to precedent: formulas and stereotypes guide the design, rather than the intrinsic nature of the situation and universal design principles. This path to authenticity often results in gardens empty of significance and unintegrated with the landscapes around them. Two obvious examples are "Zen" gardens and the use of stone lantern replicas.
A wealthy Japanese industrialist, in a gesture of friendship for an American city, offered to create an "authentic" Japanese garden. From Japan, he sent 500 orchid trees, a 300-year-old lantern, six additional stone lanterns, an eight-ton, eight-foot-high granite statue of Hotei (the smiling god of prosperity), a 15-foot-tall stone pagoda, three bridges, a teahouse, and an arbor. He also hired a famous Japanese landscape architect, six Japanese carpenters, and three Japanese gardeners. Yet the resulting landscape was burdened by clich√©s and lacked the sublimity we immediately recognize in the best Japanese gardens.
On the precedent-driven path to authenticity, the authority for the design comes from the outside and is imposed‚Äîupon those who will use the garden, upon the site (a certain amount of adaptation to the site is acceptable as long as it does not violate precedent), and upon the choice and use of materials (if the "right" types of rocks, ornaments such as stone lanterns, and plants are not available locally, they are imported. Indeed, importing them from Japan makes them more authentic).
The second, higher, path to authenticity follows a metaphorical, situation-driven approach to the tradition. Here, the inspiration for the design comes from within‚Äîfrom the desires and culture of those who will use the garden, from the site and its surroundings (including the regional landscape), and from locally available materials. While those with a shallow understanding of tradition tend to adhere more rigidly to convention, those with a deeper understanding are free to respond to the situation and, in so doing, break with precedent. My teacher, Kinsaku Nakane, put it this way: "Japanese garden design is totally free." David Engel, who apprenticed under Tansai Sano in Kyoto in the 1950s, recalls his teacher's frequent insistence that "I feel free when designing gardens. 'Don't be held down by tired, outworn ideas and practices,' he would say."
Examples abound of Japanese garden designs that broke with precedent in inspired responses to specific situations. The dry landscape garden (karesansui) of Daisen-in was created during the same era when Japanese monochrome ink painting emulating the Chinese masters of the Sung period reached its peak in Japan, the late 15th and early 16th century. The garden translates the atmospheric effects of this style of painting into a three-dimensional composition of rocks and plants, almost as if the landscape had been painted on the outer walls of this Zen Buddhist temple. The craggy peaks, set against the white plaster wall (which serves much the same function as white paper or silk), seem shrouded in mist. Gardens like Daisen-in and the now-famous garden at Ryoan-ji are prototypes‚Äîinspired responses to their cultural environment that lend fresh new voices to the tradition of landscape evocation.
Necessity is the mother of invention, as the adage goes, and played an important part in the evolution of another Japanese garden prototype, the tea garden. This new landscape form sought to re-create the experience of imbibing a cup of green tea in the ambiance of a rustic hermit's hut. In Space and Illusion in the Japanese Garden, Teiji Itoh tells the story of a 15th-century shogun, Ashikaga Yoshimasa, who, returning one day from a hawking expedition, stopped at a tea master's hermitage. Because the path through the garden was muddy, Yoshimasa's attendants spread out things for him to walk on. As the story goes, this gave the tea master the idea of laying flat stones at intervals along the garden path. So it appears that stepping stones were at first used as a practical solution.
Half a century later, the great tea master Sen no Rikyu (1521-1591) asserted that stepping stones were 60 percent functional and 40 percent aesthetic. By the early 17th century, Rikyu's distinguished disciple, Furuta Oribe (1544-1615), had reversed his teacher's formula, and a tea garden without stepping stones was unthinkable. In a still later development, the courtyard garden, a style developed for the space between the outer shop and inner living quarters of Kyoto's urban commoners, stepping stones were used purely for their aesthetic appeal; they had no practical function.
Prototypes become types and, finally, stereotypes. By the time Englishman Josiah Conder went to Japan in the 1870s to teach Western architecture at the Imperial University of Tokyo, the gardens he saw were clich√©s. His Landscape Architecture in Japan (1893) was the first detailed book on Japanese gardens available to Westerners. "In spite of his really great efforts to learn about gardens, Conder's knowledge of his subject was extremely limited," asserts Loraine Kuck in The World of the Japanese Garden, "for it was derived almost entirely from the decadent [late] Tokugawa [and early Meiji] gardens in Tokyo" and from the popular how-to books of the time. "The pictures and his report on the curiously poetic names for rocks and trees and the astounding conventions said to rule the garden craft of Japan," she wrote, "aroused interest in Japanese gardens which has never abated. It also led to considerable misunderstanding." Unfortunately, such misconceptions continue to mislead many today.
A gardener at one public Japanese garden once confided to me, with some chagrin, that at a committee meeting some members had expressed the desire to "enhance" the garden by adding black rope and wood crutch supports to the pine trees, something they apparently had seen in other Japanese gardens. The problem, of course, is that they were fascinated by the trappings but did not reflect on their purpose. Fortunately, other committee members rejected the idea, comparing black rope and crutch supports for the pines to a perfectly healthy person walking around with bandages and a cane. In fact, this technique of using black rope and wooden crutches to support or alter the position of tree branches is rarely needed, and rarely used, in Japan. My apprenticeship taught me that the primary technique for guiding the growth of trees is selective pruning, done throughout the life and according to the growth habit of the specimen.
No Japanese garden motif has been governed by more formulaic rules, or more freely interpreted, than another tea garden element, the stone water basin. Usually set on the ground so that one must crouch down to dip the water, the basin evokes a mountain brook flowing into a pool of cool, pure water where one can rinse away the cares of the world and refresh the spirit. There are basins with natural shapes, basins hollowed out of recycled foundation stones, and others with geometrical designs. Northeast of the Shokintei teahouse at the Katsura Villa in Kyoto, stepping stones lead down to the rocky shore and out into the pond, where guests can rinse their hands. Here, the water basin archetype has been expanded to embrace the shores of a pond, an idea attributed to famed garden designer Kobori Enshu (1579-1647). This is the kind of metaphorical leap that occurs when a designer is sensitive not only to the demands of tradition but also to the possibilities of the site and the client's taste. Enshu manages to evoke a mountain hut perched on a rocky shore and at the same time remind us of the origin of the water basin‚Äîa crystal stream where people, as well as other creatures, would come for cleansing and refreshment.
Why not take our cues from such examples? Why not tailor ornaments like stone lanterns and water basins out of local materials to meet the needs of the individual garden and make it the exception to use imported designs? A recycled old barn stone might serve as a "lighthouse" on a desolate shore, or native stones might be used to create a stone lantern. A water basin might be a hollowed-out glacial granite boulder, or cast-in-place concrete with the aggregate exposed by washing before it fully sets up. The water basin spout, if there is one, might be made of black bamboo, if it happens to be growing locally, or from the branch of a sycamore tree.
Samuel Newsom offers a useful guideline for incorporating stone ornaments in Japanese landscape design. "People are sometimes carried away by an object because it is old or has a history, regardless of its suitability and artistic value," he observes in Japanese Garden Construction. He encourages readers to resist that tendency and include in their garden designs "only necessary things, or things which truly contribute to the beauty of the scene."
Design the garden so that its beauty accords with the site and responds to the passage of time as sensitively as do leaves in a whispering breeze, with nothing clumsy or coarse about it. The result must be fascinating in a quiet, graceful way.
The above passage from Illustrations for Designing Mountain, Water, and Hillside Field Landscapes (1466), sets a high standard for landscape designers, one that cannot be achieved simply by following rules. Even the author of Tsukiyama Teizoden (1828), the first "do-it-yourself" Japanese garden manual, cautioned against taking the rules he set down too seriously: "Though these are called rules, they are simply intended to show the general principles to which people should adhere. These laws are not fixed and immutable. A stone by such and such a name need not be placed here and another there unless desired. They are only suggestions to be developed appropriately. People fettered by formal ideas should realize this and strive to improve their art." Josiah Conder, if he was aware of it, did not transmit this caution to his Western audience.
If rules are too rigid, then what sort of principles might better guide us when we create Japanese gardens? If we think metaphorically, we can find some general guidelines applicable to a wide range of design situations, and avoid getting bogged down by formulas and details.
I found my own bare-bones framework for responding to design situations in the theory of landscape design implicit in the opening two pages of the Illustrations. The gist of this theory is that a good garden results when the designer is attuned to three essential sources of information and inspiration: the needs and desires of the persons for whom the garden is being created, the nature of the site and the surrounding landscape, and the nature of locally available materials. It's handy to have a name for this triad of essential sources of information and inspiration, so I call it the "Accord Triangle." Some things to consider about the user's nature and needs are: what is his or her favorite landscape? What is the budget? More universal design strategies come into play here as well, such as making the garden pleasing to the senses, and making it resonate with its cultural context. Site considerations include topography, solar orientation, prevailing winds, and any existing trees and architectural elements. The nature of the site and surrounding landscape are important sources of inspiration for the garden design. For example, a wooded hillside might suggest a path leading to a small viewing pavilion. Rocks and plants are locally, or at least regionally, available materials that can inspire the design. Are the rocks, which are used to create geological effects, smooth or craggy or in flat slabs? Is the soil rocky, sandy, or clay loam? Is it poorly or well drained? Is the site sunny or shady? Such factors will determine which plants will best evoke the desired landscape experience.
This approach to creating a Japanese garden is driven by both the specific situation and universal principles of human perception. It makes us responsive to the range of feelings, forces, and qualities that manifest themselves in each unique design situation, rather than forcing us to adhere to a limited range of acceptable forms prescribed by an external authority. It is a way of working from the inside out, as opposed to superimposing an external style or set of ideas. It also encourages us, as we are urged by the author of the Illustrations, to "maintain an attitude of reverence and respect, and not simply do what [we] alone find interesting." Neither the garden designer nor the viewer is a blank slate; rather, each of us is a reservoir of past experience. The Japanese garden tradition opens our eyes not only to the beauty of the landscape of our own country and region, but also to its reflection in our own cultural heritage and personal experience.
An intuitive awareness of timeless principles‚Äîuniversal truths of nature, including human nature‚Äîenables us to effectively design the garden in accord with both the natural environment and the human body. The timeless truths of nature are built into the very fiber of our being; we need no formal learning to apprehend them. We all grasp intuitively the "meaning" of a mountain torrent rushing through its rocky chasm; of a meandering river, wide in the foreground and narrowing to a thread in the distance; or of an ancient gnarled tree, with snaking roots anchoring it in the rock and a thick, twisting trunk spiraling out in a dance of windswept branches.
Registering on our senses directly, proportional relationships have the power to evoke such aesthetic feelings as movement, depth, harmony, and serenity. Certain ratios occur frequently in nature and exert a special pull on our senses. The Golden Section (1:1.618) is the supreme example: it occurs in nature in everything from coiled fern fronds to sea shells and has been applied in the arts of cultures as different as those of Japan and Greece. One does not have to look far in Japanese gardens to discover the use of this proportion. For example, the 15th-century garden manual, the Illustrations, specifies how different-size rocks relate to one another in landscape compositions; by far the most common proportion is the Golden Section. It is clear in the Illustrations, however, that such proportions should not be taken as absolutes, but rather as guides, to be interpreted according to the situation, through the designer's intuition. Thinking in terms of horizontal, vertical, and diagonal planes helps structure a garden design. As in the rock formation above, the diagonal plane evokes exciting dynamism.
Working closely with proportion are the "Three Forces" (also described in the Illustrations)‚Äîhorizontal, vertical, and diagonal. The Three Forces are powerful tools for structuring our designs, as each one can be counted upon to elicit a specific and fundamental aesthetic response. The horizontal plane, associated with level earth and bodies of water, evokes an expansive, easy movement, and thus serenity. The vertical plane evokes the tension and power required when movement is heavenward, in opposition to the force of gravity. In the garden, or nature, this is felt in towering rock formations, and the threadlike waterfalls that sometimes plummet from such precipices. Daisen-in's twin peaks, like Manhattan's early skyscrapers and Gothic cathedrals, use diminishing proportion (they progressively narrow toward the top) to heighten their verticality. The diagonal plane, associated with such vertical objects as trees succumbing to the force of gravity and upthrust rock formations, evokes an exciting dynamism ring on instability. Together, the Three Forces form the three sides of a scalene triangle, a triangle with unequal sides. An asymmetry of forces always feels more natural, dynamic, and inviting in the garden, just as it does in the natural landscape.
To the Three Forces, we need to add one other essential element that enlivens both Japanese gardens and natural landscape with its well-proportioned twists and turns‚Äîthe S-curve. A softening of the Z-zigzag, the S-curve is evident in the flow of rivers and highways, as well as in the lines that define the edge between land and sea, foothills and prairie, or hills and valley. While the sharp-cornered Z-zigzag may be used to evoke rocky mountain landscapes, the S-curve is found in more gentle terrain, where the topography has eroded over the ages.
The S-curve is also one of a number of techniques used to enhance the sense of mystery and depth in Japanese gardens. An S-curve path, for example, invites further exploration and is universally preferred over a straight path, which reveals all at a glance. The sense of mystery can be deepened with techniques of "hide-and-reveal" (mie-gakure) by obscuring the path here and there with plantings, rock outcroppings, or hillocks in a natural way.
The partially concealed S-curve works its magic in the vertical plane as well as the horizontal ground plane. In nature, and in Japanese gardens, we find it in the sculptural trunk and branching of evergreens like pines and junipers, with their green-tufted foliage floating in cloudlike layers. The Chinese and Japanese for centuries have used pruning techniques that simulate the effects of wind and age: an umbrella-shaped crown, an S-curved trunk, and a zigzag branching structure revealed in the spaces between masses of foliage at the branch tips. A visceral sense of rootedness, of connection to the earth, is evoked by the thick, gnarled trunk and outstretching branches of the tree's lower portion, while an ethereal sense, the visual equivalent of the sound of wind soughing through pines, is evoked by the airy filigree of upper branches silhouetted against the sky.
We need not be limited to pines or even conifers to achieve such effects. We can choose other trees that appeal to us from our own environment and experience. A similar gnarled branching pattern and proportionate decreasing of branch spacing is characteristic of such North American natives as sassafras and persimmon, for instance. It is very much in the spirit of Japanese design to look to locally available materials, rather than exotics, to satisfy our design needs.
Evocation of natural scenery is at the heart of Japanese landscape design. This is emphasized in the general guidelines at the beginning of the 11th century manual, Sakuteiki (Notes on Garden Making):
You should design each part of the garden tastefully, recalling your memories of how nature presented itself for each feature...Think over the famous places of scenic beauty throughout the land, and design your garden with the mood of harmony, modeling after the general air of such places.
While Sakuteiki's author could not have imagined that his words would be read by foreigners eight centuries after he wrote them, he would have understood our fervent desire to grasp the underlying spirit and principles of this landscape art. Were he to travel to North America and other foreign lands today, I think he would be the first to recommend that we take the metaphorical path to authenticity‚Äîthat is, take inspiration from our own native landscapes. For centuries, garden designers in Japan have found inspiration in such coastal scenery as that along the Japan Sea.
When Kinsaku Nakane designed Tenshin-en, the Japanese dry landscape garden at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, he found inspiration not in the scenic landscapes of Japan but rather, as he put it, in New England's "rocky coastlines, deep forests, soft hillsides, and craggy mountains." A composition of 150 boulders brought from Boston's North Shore and set into undulating earth mounds evokes the geological structure of nearby mountains and offshore islands. Plants like Japanese cryptomeria, stewartia, and maple are combined with Eastern hemlock and American holly to evoke the natural habitat of a New England mixed hardwood-conifer forest. Native conifers with lighter green needles, such as tamarack or white spruce, could easily have taken the place of cryptomeria to serve as a contrast with the darker green hemlock. And native small trees like amelanchier or mountain maple could have served as well as Japanese maples and stewartia to evoke the hardwoods. Using native plants is very much in the spirit of Japanese garden aesthetics, and planting so as to re-create the essence of natural habitats is a basic principle of Japanese garden design set forth in the Illustrations. Which habitats one chooses to evoke will, of course, depend on the site and design inspiration. The beauty of Japanese garden design is in large part due to integration‚Äîthings are done because they are fitting rather than for show. This larger principle underlies the higher path of authenticity and is aptly illustrated by an exchange between tea master Sen no Rikyu and a pupil as related in Cha-no-Yu: The Japanese Tea Ceremony:
Seto Kamon Masatada of Omi was first a retainer of the house of Hojo and afterwards served Toyotomi Hideyoshi. He was Rikyu's pupil in Tea and became so expert that he was numbered among the Seven Masters of the day. He was once invited to Rikyu's house and after the tea was over he happened to notice a dipper that lay on the shelf and was much taken with its shape, praising it exceedingly.
Rikyu asked what he saw in it, and he replied that it looked a better shape than those commonly used. "Indeed," said Rikyu, "and why?" "It seems to be a bit shorter than usual, and that gives it a very interesting appearance," replied Masatada. "I should like to have one like it." Some time after this Masatada invited Rikyu to his house, and when the tea was over and the utensils were being put away, Rikyu remarked, "The dipper you used today seems a bit too short." "Ah, but I liked the look of the one I saw at your house so well that I made my own short to match it," replied Masatada. "Ah," said Rikyu with a sigh, "I am afraid you don't yet understand the real spirit of tea, though I thought you did. I am a little man, as you see, and so I have a small dipper to suit my size. But you, on the other hand, are a big fellow, so it is natural for you to use a larger one. What do you want with a small one?" At this enlightenment dawned suddenly on Masatada, and in the future, he had a large size dipper made.
Sometimes we need encouragement to move from focusing narrowly and literally to seeing the larger picture‚Äîto move from the low to the high path of authenticity. Japanese garden design is not just a style of landscaping. It is an art deeply rooted in a way of thinking and feeling about our place in nature. To me, one of the wonders of the art of the Japanese garden is that it has shown a great capacity for seamlessly merging evolving human knowledge with the wisdom of wildness. For this reason it can serve as a beacon to human cultures in the coming centuries, as we seek ways to live in harmony with our earthly home.
