Zen Rock Garden - History, Philosophy, and How-To Guide
Komyozen-ji Rock Garden in Fukuoka, Japan
Originated in Japan, the Zen rock garden defies the definition of a "garden" in almost every conventional sense. It isn't a place to find rows of lush trees, an ornate gazebo, or a pond filled with beautiful fish. There is no field of green grass but sand, gravel, and sparse scattering of moss and nondescript shrubs. Nor is there much contrast in colors, as flowers are nowhere to be seen. Before learning how you may design and create a rock garden of your own, it's crucial to understand how this unique landscaping style has come to be and what fundamental philosophy is behind its creation.

Brief History - Evolution of the Japanese Rock Garden
5th - 8th Century
To understand the evolution of the Zen rock garden, we first need to look back to the fifth century when Chinese Taoism started to make an imprint on Japanese art. It is an ancient Taoist belief that somewhere in the middle of the ocean, there are three or five islands where immortals dwell. In Japanese literature, this belief is manifested in the form of a folktale about a fisherman named Urashima Taro who saves the life of a sea turtle, which in return, takes him to one of the immortal islands. There the fisherman marries a princess and becomes immortal. As time goes by, however, he is stricken with homesickness and decides to return to his old village. Sadly, not long after he sets foot on the familiar shore of his birthplace, the fisherman immediately grows old and dies
The Taoist immortal islands had not only inspired storytellers but also garden creators in Japan from the fifth to eighth century, so much so that the word for "garden" in those days was "shima", meaning "island." A typical Japanese garden in this period would usually comprise a large pond surrounded by lush trees. In the middle of the pond floated at least one island or sometimes just a big mountain-like rock, symbolizing the land of unfading youth and eternal life as appeared in the tale of Urashima Taro.
The Heian Period (Late 8th - 12th Century)
As Japan's capital was moved to Heian-Kyo (Kyoto) in 794, artists and garden makers began to avert their attention from Chinese Taoism and devoted their efforts to developing art that would reflect their own culture. Gardens were arranged in ways that portrayed Japanese natural landscapes, and Buddhism became a dominant, inspirational force behind their creations. Although the pond and islands remained the integral parts of Japanese gardens in this period, all the other elements were selected and organized in a much more scrupulous manner. For example, the constructions surrounding the garden must be connected to each other by lengthy covered galleries. There was a preference for deciduous trees whose shapes and colors would shift from season to season. Even birds in the trees and fish in the pond were considered parts of the garden composition.
This style of Japanese garden both depicts the core of Buddhism as well as the anxiety of civil wars that raged throughout the country in the second half of the Heian period. The incessantly altering state of the garden echoes the Buddhist teaching about the evanescence of our being and the never-ending cycle of death and rebirth. On the psychological level, it shows that the ominous wars had awakened people to recognize the precariousness of life and find reasons to be more sensitive to ephemeral beauty of nature; magnificent spring flowers that were so short-lived; colorful foliage that would die in the bitterness of winter.

The Muromachi Period (14th - 16th Century)
Around the late 11th century in the Heian period, dry rocky landscapes were built as a part of mainstream gardens. The professional landscapers back then were called "ishitate-so", meaning "monks who arrange rocks." It might sound a bit strange to us, modern citizens, but since Buddhism was so critical in the art of gardens in those days, it wasn't surprising at all that monks were the ones responsible for designing and creating Zen gardens. It wasn't until the Muromachi period that the Zen rock garden was fully developed, rose to its fame and continued its legacy to this day. Muso Soseki, a great Zen monk, was said to be the father of Zen landscaping who created some of the oldest rock gardens and brought popularity to this enigmatic landscaping technique.
While Heian gardens mirrored the vicissitudes of life, Muromachi rock gardens completely rejected transitory phenomena and meaningless facades of material world. Garden makers in this period stripped nature bare and created Zen gardens mainly out of rocks and sand, in order to reveal the true substance of life and nature. Occasionally, small evergreen bushes were added but not portrayed as the focal element. This doesn't mean that the Muromachi landscapers totally neglected the tradition of pond gardens of the earlier days, though. Zen rock gardens are basically pond gardens without water. Zen monks draw wavy patterns in the sand with a rake as a way to mimic undulating movements of streams. All the rocks in the garden also represent elements found in regular Japanese gardens, such as islands, mountains, trees, bridges and even animals. Muso Soseki beautifully summed up this idea of imaginary components in his poem, "Ode to the Dry Landscape":
Without a speck of dust being raised,
the mountains tower up;
without a single drop falling,
the streams plunge into the valley.
All the Zen gardens that come after the Muromachi period are an evolving part of its legacy. To this day, new rock gardens continue to emerge in Japan and various countries. There are countless variations born of modern landscapers' distinctive imagination and creativity. Yet, Zen gardens built in the Muromachi period always remain revered as the ancient prototypes of this unique landscaping style.
Philosophy Behind the Zen Rock Garden
Traditionally, Zen rock gardens are not meant for picnics or other recreational activities. It is a sacred realm for Zen monks to perform their daily practice. The Japanese word "niwa" that means "garden" nowadays actually denoted "a ritual space" in the ancient time. So how can a seemingly barren garden have such significance in those clergymen's practice? In Zen Buddhism, reading scriptures and reciting prayers are considered to be superficial activities. To attain enlightenment, one must also undergo long periods of sitting meditation as well as physical work. At the rock garden, Zen monks contemplate upon nature and search for the utmost freedom of the mind. The true purpose behind the sand raking isn't to create something aesthetically pleasing but to train their own thought; it is, in other words, an implicit form of moving meditation.
Buddha Nature - Zen is a branch of Buddhism, which should not be considered a religion, at least not in a conventional sense, as it has nothing to do with divine power or metaphysical theories of human existence. It is simply a school of thought or a mode of thinking. The main activity of being a Zen is not to study Zen, but rather, to study oneself and regain one's "original nature", which is often referred to as "Buddha nature." Everyone was born with Buddha nature, but as we age, we become attached to things and experiences we have encountered. To rediscover our Buddha nature doesn't mean to forget everything or to be na√Øve, but to see things with a mind that is open to all possibilities, ready to accept and to doubt; a mind that isn't hindered by ego, desires, prejudice or selfish obsession. Without realizing our Buddha nature, our activities will always be affected by our preconceived ideas and fragmented, spinning mind. We don't fully see anything as it is but receive everything just as an echo of ourselves. By stripping a garden to its bare bones, Zen monks create a miniature image of the universe in its rawest form, which they believe can remind humans of their own deepest nature.
Reality vs Manipulation of Nature - In a Zen rock garden, the rocks may represent mountains or trees or animals. The sand may symbolize an expanse of water or a waterfall slithering down a mountain. Yet, in reality, the rocks are just rocks, and the sand is just sand. This, in a profound way, reflects how humans habitually manipulate nature, assign meanings to things around us and in the process of that, fool ourselves into becoming obsessed with those empty values. Diamonds, for example, are something lots of people adore and long to own. Many are more than willing to pay high prices or even get in debt for a tiny piece of this gemstone. The diamond is supposed to represent luxury, beauty and eternal love. In many cases, it becomes a reason for envy, greed and superficial happiness. But in reality, isn't it just a shiny rock? Contemplating upon the bareness and simplicity of a Zen rock garden, one may learn how to perceive the true substance of nature and see things beyond their meaningless appearances.

How to Make a Japanese Rock Garden
Take a careful look at your backyard and decide where you want to build your rock garden. Decide on its size and shape. Most rock gardens are rectangular or square, but there's nothing wrong with building yours in a circular or irregular shape. Also, bigger doesn't necessarily mean better. A small Zen garden can bring just as much peace to your mind as a spacious one does.
Remove all the grass from the area on which you want to create your rock garden.
Dig a shallow trench of about two to three inches deep around the border.
Cover the area with a landscaping tarp. This will prevent weeds from growing and poking through the sand.
Tuck the edges of the tarp into the trench.
Put bricks or small rocks over the trench to secure the tarp and also to create the border for your garden. If you don't want to use bricks or rocks, you may build a low wooden fence over the trench instead. Bamboo is probably the most common type of wood for Zen garden borders.
Lay sand or gravel (or a mixture of both) all over the tarp. Try to make the surface as even as possible. If you live in an area that is very windy or has a long rainy season, gravel is a better material for your Zen garden, as it tends to be less affected by wind and rain.
Arrange some rocks on your Zen garden, then rake the sand to create an image of streams or ripples.
Add some moss, small bushes, a bench for meditation or some garden lamps if you like.
Your Zen garden is complete!
The ability to capture the essence of nature makes the Japanese gardens distinctive and appealing to observers. Traditional Japanese gardens are very different in style from occidental gardens. The contrast between western flower gardens and Japanese gardens is profound. "Western gardens are typically optimised for visual appeal while Japanese gardens are modelled with spiritual and philosophical ideas in mind."[26] Japanese gardens have always been conceived as a representation of a natural setting. The Japanese have always had a spiritual connection with their land and the spirits that are one with nature, which explains why they prefer to incorporate natural materials in their gardens. Traditional Japanese gardens can be categorized into three types: tsukiyama (hill gardens), karesansui (dry gardens) and chaniwa gardens (tea gardens). The main purpose of a Japanese garden is to attempt to be a space that captures the natural beauties of nature.
The small space given to create these gardens usually poses a challenge for the gardeners. Due to the absolute importance of the arrangement of natural rocks and trees, finding the right material becomes highly selective. The serenity of a Japanese landscape and the simple but deliberate structures of the Japanese gardens are what truly make the gardens unique. "The two main principles incorporated in a Japanese garden are scaled reduction and symbolization."
Japanese gardens always have water, either a pond or stream, or, in the dry rock garden, represented by white sand. In Buddhist symbolism, water and stone are the yin and yang, two opposites that complement and complete each other. A traditional garden will usually have an irregular-shaped pond or, in larger gardens, two or more ponds connected by a channel or stream, and a cascade, a miniature version of Japan's famous mountain waterfalls.
In traditional gardens, the ponds and streams are carefully placed according to Buddhist geomancy, the art of putting things in the place most likely to attract good fortune. The rules for the placement of water were laid out in the first manual of Japanese gardens, the Sakuteiki ("Records of Garden Making"), in the 11th century. According to the Sakuteiki, the water should enter the garden from the east or southeast and flow toward the west because the east is the home of the Green Dragon (seiryu) an ancient Chinese divinity adapted in Japan, and the west is the home of the White Tiger, the divinity of the east. Water flowing from east to west will carry away evil, and the owner of the garden will be healthy and have a long life. According to the Sakuteiki, another favorable arrangement is for the water to flow from north, which represents water in Buddhist cosmology, to the south, which represents fire, which are opposites (yin and yang) and therefore will bring good luck.[28]
The Sakuteiki recommends several possible miniature landscapes using lakes and streams: the "ocean style", which features rocks that appear to have been eroded by waves, a sandy beach, and pine trees; the "broad river style", recreating the course of a large river, winding like a serpent; the "marsh pond" style, a large still pond with aquatic plants; the "mountain torrent style", with many rocks and cascades; and the "rose letters" style, an austere landscape with small, low plants, gentle relief and many scattered flat rocks.
Traditional Japanese gardens have small islands in the lakes. In sacred temple gardens, there is usually an island which represents Mount Penglai or Mount H≈çrai, the traditional home of the Eight Immortals.
The Sakuteiki describes different kinds of artificial island which can be created in lakes, including the "mountainous island", made up of jagged vertical rocks mixed with pine trees, surrounded by a sandy beach; the "rocky island", composed of "tormented" rocks appearing to have been battered by sea waves, along with small, ancient pine trees with unusual shapes; the "cloud island", made of white sand in the rounded white forms of a cumulus cloud; and the "misty island", a low island of sand, without rocks or trees.
A cascade or waterfall is an important element in Japanese gardens, a miniature version of the waterfalls of Japanese mountain streams. The Sakuteiki describes seven kinds of cascades. It notes that if possible a cascade should face toward the moon and should be designed to capture the moon's reflection in the water.[29] It is also mentioned in Sakuteiki that cascades benefit from being located in such a manner that they are half-hidden in shadows.
Rock, sand and gravel are an essential feature of the Japanese garden. A vertical rock may represent Mount Horai, the legendary home of the Eight Immortals, or Mount Sumeru of Buddhist teaching, or a carp jumping from the water. A flat rock might represent the earth. Sand or gravel can represent a beach, or a flowing river. Rocks and water also symbolize yin and yang (in and y≈ç in Japanese) in Buddhist philosophy; the hard rock and soft water complement each other, and water, though soft, can wear away rock.
Rough volcanic rocks (kasei-gan) are usually used to represent mountains or as stepping stones. Smooth and round sedimentary rocks (suisei-gan) are used around lakes or as stepping stones. Hard metamorphic rocks are usually placed by waterfalls or streams. Rocks are traditionally classified as tall vertical, low vertical, arching, reclining, or flat. Rocks should vary in size and color but from each other, but not have bright colors, which would lack subtlety. Rocks with strata or veins should have the veins all going in the same direction, and the rocks should all be firmly planted in the earth, giving an appearance of firmness and permanence. Rocks are arranged in careful compositions of two, three, five or seven rocks, with three being the most common. In a three-arrangement, a tallest rock usually represents heaven, the shortest rock is the earth, and the medium-sized rock is humanity, the bridge between heaven and earth. Sometimes one or more rocks, called suteishi ("nameless" or "discarded"), are placed in seemingly random locations in the garden, to suggest spontaneity, though their placement is carefully chosen.[30]
In ancient Japan, sand (suna) and gravel (jari) were used around Shinto shrines and Buddhist temples. Later it was used in the Japanese rock garden or Zen Buddhist gardens to represent water or clouds. White sand represented purity, but sand could also be gray, brown or bluish-black.[31]
Selection and subsequent placement of rocks was and still is a central concept in creating an aesthetically pleasing garden by the Japanese. During the Heian period, the concept of placing stones as symbolic representations of islands ‚Äì whether physically existent or nonexistent ‚Äì began to take hold, and can be seen in the Japanese word shima, which is of "particular importance ... because the word contained the meaning 'island'" Furthermore, the principle of kowan ni shitagau, or "obeying (or following) the request of an object", was, and still is, a guiding principle of Japanese rock design that suggests "the arrangement of rocks be dictated by their innate characteristics". The specific placement of stones in Japanese gardens to symbolically represent islands (and later to include mountains), is found to be an aesthetically pleasing property of traditional Japanese gardens. Here are some of the aesthetic principles, as stated by Thomas Heyd:
Stones, which constitute a fundamental part of Japanese gardens, are carefully selected for their weathering and are placed in such a way that they give viewers the sense that they ‚Äònaturally‚Äô belong where they are, and in combinations in which the viewers [sic] find them. As such, this form of gardening attempts to emblematically represent (or present) the processes and spaces found in wild nature, away from city and practical concerns of human life
Rock placement is a general "aim to portray nature in its essential characteristics"[32] ‚Äì the essential goal of all Japanese gardens. Furthermore,
while the cult of stones is also central to Japanese gardening ‚Ä¶ as stones were part of an aesthetic design and had to be placed so that their positions appeared natural and their relationships harmonious. The concentration of the interest on such detail as the shape of a rock or the moss on a stone lantern led at times to an overemphatic picturesqueness and accumulation of minor features that, to Western eyes accustomed to a more general survey, may seem cluttered and restless.
Such attention to detail can be seen at places such as Midori Falls in Kenroku-en Garden in Kanazawa, Ishikawa Prefecture, as the rocks at the waterfall's base were changed at various times by six different daimy≈çs.
In Heian-period Japanese gardens, built in the Chinese model, buildings occupied as much or more space than the garden. The garden was designed to be seen from the main building and its verandas, or from small pavilions built for that purpose. In later gardens, the buildings were less visible. Rustic teahouses were hidden in their own little gardens, and small benches and open pavilions along the garden paths provided places for rest and contemplation. In later garden architecture, walls of houses and teahouses could be opened to provide carefully framed views of the garden. The garden and the house became one.[34]
Bridges first appeared in the Japanese garden during the Heian period. At By≈çd≈ç-in garden in Kyoto, a wooden bridge connects the Phoenix pavilion with a small island of stones, representing the Mount Penglai or Mount Horai, the island home of the Eight Immortals of Daoist teaching, The bridge symbolized the path to paradise and immortality.
Bridges could be made of stone (ishibashi), or of wood, or made of logs with earth on top, covered with moss (dobashi); they could be either arched (soribashi) or flat (hirabashi). Sometimes if they were part of a temple garden, they were painted red, following the Chinese tradition, but for the most part they were unpainted.[36]
During the Edo period, when large promenade gardens became popular, streams and winding paths were constructed, with a series of bridges, usually in a rustic stone or wood style, to take visitors on a tour of the scenic views of the garden.
Japanese stone lanterns (Âè∞ÁÅØÁ±†, dai-d≈çr≈ç, "platform lamp") date back to the Nara period and the Heian period. Originally they were located only at Buddhist temples, where they lined the paths and approaches to the temple, but in the Heian period they began to be used at Shinto shrines as well. According to tradition, during the Momoyama period they were introduced to the tea garden by the first great tea masters, and in later gardens they were used purely for decoration.
In its complete and original form, a dai-doro, like the pagoda, represents the five elements of Buddhist cosmology. The piece touching the ground represents chi, the earth; the next section represents sui, or water; ka or fire, is represented by the section encasing the lantern's light or flame, while f≈´ (air) and k≈´ (void or spirit) are represented by the last two sections, top-most and pointing towards the sky. The segments express the idea that after death our physical bodies will go back to their original, elemental form.[37]
Stone water basins (tsukubai) were originally placed in gardens for visitors to wash their hands and mouth before the tea ceremony. The water is provided to the basin by a bamboo pipe, or kakei, and they usually have a wooden ladle for drinking the water. In tea gardens, the basin was placed low to the ground, so the drinker had to bend over to get water
Nothing in a Japanese garden is natural or left to chance; each plant is chosen according to aesthetic principles, either to hide undesirable sights, to serve as a backdrop to certain garden features, or to create a picturesque scene, like a landscape painting or postcard. Trees are carefully chosen and arranged for their autumn colors. Moss is often used to suggest that the garden is ancient. Flowers are also carefully chosen by their season of flowering. Formal flowerbeds are rare in older gardens, but more common in modern gardens. Some plants are chosen for their religious symbolism, such as the lotus, sacred in Buddhist teachings, or the pine, which represents longevity.
The trees are carefully trimmed to provide attractive scenes, and to prevent them from blocking other views of the garden. Their growth is also controlled, in a technique called niwaki, to give them more picturesque shapes, and to make them look more ancient. It has been suggested that the characteristic shape of pruned Japanese garden trees resemble trees found naturally in savannah landscapes. This resemblance has been used to motivate the so called Savannah hypothesis.[39] Trees are sometimes constrained to bend, in order to provide shadows or better reflections in the water. Very old pine trees are often supported by wooden crutches, or their branches are held by cords, to keep them from breaking under the weight of snow.
In the late 16th century, a new art was developed in the Japanese garden; that of ≈çkarikomi (Â§ßÂààËæº), the technique of trimming bushes into balls or rounded shapes which imitate waves. According to tradition this art was developed by Kobori Ensh≈´ (1579‚Äì1647), and it was most frequently practiced on azalea bushes. It was similar to the topiary gardens made in Europe at the same time, except that European topiary gardens tried to make trees look like geometric solid objects, while ≈çkarkikomi sought to make bushes look as if they were almost liquid, or in flowing natural shapes. It created an artistic play of light on the surface of the bush, and, according to garden historian Michel Baridon, "it also brought into play the sense of 'touching things' which even today succeeds so well in Japanese design."[40][41]
The most common trees and plants found in Japanese gardens are the azalea (tsutsuji), the camellia (tsubaki), the oak (kashiwa), the elm (nire), the Japanese apricot (ume), cherry (sakura), maple (momiji), the willow (yanagi), the ginkgo (ich≈ç), the Japanese cypress (hinoki), the Japanese cedar (sugi), pine (matsu), and bamboo (take).
The use of fish, particularly nishiki-goi (colored carp), or goldfish as a decorative element in gardens was borrowed from the Chinese garden. Goldfish were developed in China more than a thousand years ago by selectively breeding Prussian carp for color mutations. By the Song dynasty (960‚Äì1279), yellow, orange, white and red-and-white colorations had been developed. Goldfish were introduced to Japan in the 16th century. Koi were developed from common carp (Cyprinus carpio) in Japan in the 1820s. Koi are domesticated common carp that are selected or culled for color; they are not a different species, and will revert to the original coloration within a few generations if allowed to breed freely.[42][43] In addition to fish, turtles are kept in some gardens. Natural environments in the gardens offer habitats that attract wild animals; frogs and birds are notable as they contribute with a pleasant soundscape.[44]
The early Japanese gardens largely followed the Chinese model, but gradually Japanese gardens developed their own principles and aesthetics. These were spelled out by a series of landscape gardening manuals, beginning with Sakuteiki ("Records of Garden Making") in the Heian Period (794‚Äì1185).[45] The principles of sacred gardens, such as the gardens of Zen Buddhist temples, were different from those of pleasure or promenade gardens; for example, Zen Buddhist gardens were designed to be seen, while seated, from a platform with a view of the whole garden, without entering it, while promenade gardens were meant to be seen by walking through the garden and stopping at a series of view points. However, they often contain common elements and used the same techniques. Some basic principles are:
Miniaturization. The Japanese garden is a miniature and idealized view of nature. Rocks can represent mountains, and ponds can represent seas. The garden is sometimes made to appear larger by placing larger rocks and trees in the foreground, and smaller ones in the background.
Concealment (miegakure, "hide and reveal"). The Zen Buddhist garden is meant to be seen all at once, but the promenade garden is meant to be seen one landscape at a time, like a scroll of painted landscapes unrolling. Features are hidden behind hills, trees groves or bamboo, walls or structures, to be discovered when the visitor follows the winding path.
Borrowed scenery (shakkei). Smaller gardens are often designed to incorporate the view of features outside the garden, such as hills, trees or temples, as part of the view. This makes the garden seem larger than it really is.
Asymmetry. Japanese gardens are not laid on straight axes, or with a single feature dominating the view. Buildings and garden features are usually placed to be seen from a diagonal, and are carefully composed into scenes that contrast right angles, such as buildings with natural features, and vertical features, such as rocks, bamboo or trees, with horizontal features, such as water.[46]
According to garden historians David and Michigo Young, at the heart of the Japanese garden is the principle that a garden is a work of art. "Though inspired by nature, it is an interpretation rather than a copy; it should appear to be natural, but it is not wild."[47]
Landscape gardener Seyemon Kusumoto wrote that the Japanese generate "the best of nature's handiwork in a limited space".[48]
The chisen-shoy≈´-teien ("lake-spring-boat excursion garden") was imported from China during the Heian period (794‚Äì1185). It is also called the shinden-zukuri style, after the architectural style of the main building. It featured a large, ornate residence with two long wings reaching south to a large lake and garden. Each wing ended in a pavilion from which guests could enjoy the views of the lake. Visitors made tours of the lake in small boats. These gardens had large lakes with small islands, where musicians played during festivals and ceremonies worshippers could look across the water at the Buddha. No original gardens of this period remain, but reconstructions can be seen at Heian-jing≈´ and Daikaku-ji temple in Kyoto.
The Paradise Garden appeared in the late Heian period, created by nobles belonging to the Amida Buddhism sect. They were meant to symbolize Paradise or the Pure Land (J≈çdo), where the Buddha sat on a platform contemplating a lotus pond. These gardens featured a lake island called Nakajima, where the Buddha hall was located, connected to the shore by an arching bridge. The most famous surviving example is the garden of the Phoenix Hall of By≈çd≈ç-in Temple, built in 1053, in Uji, near Kyoto. Other examples are J≈çruri-ji temple in Kyoto, Enro-ji temple in Nara Prefecture, the Hokongoin in Kyoto, M≈çts≈´-ji Temple in Hiraizumi, and Shiramizu Amidado Garden in Iwaki City
Karesansui gardens (ÊûØÂ±±Ê∞¥) or Japanese rock gardens, became popular in Japan in the 14th century thanks to the work of a Buddhist monk, Mus≈ç Soseki (1275‚Äì1351) who built zen gardens at the five major monasteries in Kyoto. These gardens have white sand or raked gravel in place of water, carefully arranged rocks, and sometimes rocks and sand covered with moss. Their purpose is to facilitate meditation, and they are meant to be viewed while seated on the porch of the residence of the h≈çj≈ç, the abbot of the monastery. The most famous example is Ry≈çan-ji temple in Kyoto.
The tea garden was created during the Muromachi period (1333‚Äì1573) and Momoyama period (1573‚Äì1600) as a setting for the Japanese tea ceremony, or chanoyu. The style of garden takes its name from the roji, or path to the teahouse, which is supposed to inspire the visitor to meditation to prepare him for the ceremony. There is an outer garden, with a gate and covered arbor where guests wait for the invitation to enter. They then pass through a gate to the inner garden, where they wash their hands and rinse their mouth, as they would before entering a Shinto shrine, before going into the teahouse itself. The path is always kept moist and green, so it will look like a remote mountain path, and there are no bright flowers that might distract the visitor from his meditation.[52] Early teahouses had no windows, but later teahouses have a wall which can be opened for a view of the garden.
Promenade or stroll gardens (landscape gardens in the go-round style) appeared in Japan during the Edo period (1600‚Äì1854), at the villas of nobles or warlords. These gardens were designed to complement the houses in the new sukiya-zukuri style of architecture, which were modeled after the teahouse. These gardens were meant to be seen by following a path clockwise around the lake from one carefully composed scene to another. These gardens used two techniques to provide interest: borrowed scenery ("shakkei"), which took advantage of views of scenery outside the garden such as mountains or temples, incorporating them into the view so the garden looked larger than it really was, and miegakure, or "hide-and-reveal", which used winding paths, fences, bamboo and buildings to hide the scenery so the visitor would not see it until he was at the best view point. Edo period gardens also often feature recreations of famous scenery or scenes inspired by literature; Suizen-ji J≈çju-en Garden in Kumamoto has a miniature version of Mount Fuji, and Katsura Villa in Kyoto has a miniature version of the Ama-no-hashidate sandbar in Miyazu Bay, near Kyoto. The Rikugi-en Garden in Tokyo creates small landscapes inspired by eighty-eight famous Japanese poems.
Small gardens were originally found in the interior courtyards (naka-niwa, "inner garden") of Heian period palaces, and were designed to give a glimpse of nature and some privacy to the residents of the rear side of the building. They were as small as one tsubo, or about 3.3 square meters, whence the name tsubo-niwa. During the Edo period, merchants began building small gardens in the space behind their shops, which faced the street, and their residences, located at the rear. These tiny gardens were meant to be seen, not entered, and usually had a stone lantern, a water basin, stepping stones and a few plants. Today, tsubo-niwa are found in many Japanese residences, hotels, restaurants, and public buildings.[54] A good example from the Meiji period is found in the villa of Murin-an in Kyoto.[55] Totekiko is a famous courtyard rock garden.[56]
A hermitage garden is a small garden usually built by a samurai or government official who wanted to retire from public life and devote himself to study or meditation. It is attached to a rustic house, and approached by a winding path, which suggests it is deep in a forest. It may have a small pond, a Japanese rock garden, and the other features of traditional gardens, in miniature, designed to create tranquility and inspiration. An example is the Shisen-d≈ç garden in Kyoto, built by a bureaucrat and scholar exiled by the shogun in the 17th century. It is now a Buddhist temple.
The first manual of Japanese gardening was the Sakuteiki ("Records of Garden Making"), probably written in the late eleventh century by Tachibana no Tohshitsuna (1028‚Äì1094). Citing even older Chinese sources, it explains how to organize the garden, from the placement of rocks and streams to the correct depth of ponds and height of cascades. While it was based on earlier Chinese garden principles, it also expressed ideas which were unique to Japanese gardens, such as islands, beaches and rock formations imitating Japanese maritime landscapes.[57]
Besides giving advice, Sakuteiki also gives dire warnings of what happens if the rules are not followed; the author warns that if a rock that in nature was in a horizontal position is stood upright in a garden, it will bring misfortune to the owner of the garden. And, if a large rock pointed toward the north or west is placed near a gallery, the owner of the garden will be forced to leave before a year passes.[58]
Another influential work about the Japanese garden, bonseki, bonsai and related arts was Rhymeprose on a Miniature Landscape Garden (around 1300) by the Zen monk Kokan Shiren, which explained how meditation on a miniature garden purified the senses and the mind and led to understanding of the correct relationship between man and nature.
Other influential garden manuals which helped to define the aesthetics of the Japanese garden are Senzui Narabi ni Yagyo no Zu (Illustrations for Designing Mountain, Water and Hillside Field Landscapes), written in the fifteenth century, and Tsukiyama Teizoden (Building Mountains and Making Gardens), from the 18th century. The tradition of Japanese gardening was historically passed down from sensei to apprentice. The opening words of Illustrations for designing mountain, water and hillside field landscapes (1466) are "If you have not received the oral transmissions, you must not make gardens" and its closing admonition is "You must never show this writing to outsiders. You must keep it secret".[59]
These garden manuals are still studied today.
The Tale of Genji, the classic Japanese novel of the Heian period, describes the role of the Japanese garden in court life. The characters attend festivals in the old Kyoto imperial palace garden, take boat trips on the lake, listen to music and watch formal dances under the trees.[60]
Gardens were often the subject of poems during the Heian period. A poem in one anthology from the period, the Kokin-Shu, described the Kiku-shima, or island of chrystanthemums, found in the Osawa pond in the great garden of the period called Saga-in.

only one chrysanthmum can grow.
Who therefore has planted
the other in the depths
of the pond of Osawa?
Another poem of the Heian period, in the Hyakunin isshu, described a cascade of rocks, which simulated a waterfall, in the same garden:
The cascade long ago
ceased to roar,
But we continue to hear
The murmur
of its name.
In Japanese culture, garden-making is a high art, equal to the arts of calligraphy and ink painting. Gardens are considered three-dimensional textbooks of Daoism and Zen Buddhism. Sometimes the lesson is very literal; the garden of Saih≈ç-ji featured a pond shaped like the Japanese character shin (ÂøÉ) or xƒ´n in Chinese, the heart-spirit of Chinese philosophy, the newspaper character is ÂøÉ but it's the full cursive, the sousho style (ËçâÊõ∏) for shin that would be used; sousho, this well-named "grass writing", would be appropriate for gardening purpose indeed, for in cursive writing the character shapes change depending on the context and of course, since it is cursive, depending on the person -that is to say that the character would be done in a single pencil stroke, it would match the state of mind and the context rather than the newspaper print.[clarification needed] However, usually the lessons are contained in the arrangements of the rocks, the water and the plants. For example, the lotus flower has a particular message; Its roots are in the mud at the bottom of the pond, symbolizing the misery of the human condition, but its flower is pure white, symbolizing the purity of spirit that can be achieved by following the teachings of the Buddha. [62]
The Japanese rock gardens were intended to be intellectual puzzles for the monks who lived next to them to study and solve. They followed the same principles as the suiboku-ga, the black-and-white Japanese inks paintings of the same period, which, according to Zen Buddhist principles, tried to achieve the maximum effect using the minimum essential elements.[63]
"Catching a catfish with a gourd" by Josetsu
One painter who influenced the Japanese garden was Josetsu (1405‚Äì1423), a Chinese Zen monk who moved to Japan and introduced a new style of ink-brush painting, moving away from the romantic misty landscapes of the earlier period, and using asymmetry and areas of white space, similar to the white space created by sand in zen gardens, to set apart and highlight a mountain or tree branch or other element of his painting. He became chief painter of the Shogun and influenced a generation of painters and garden designers.[64]
Japanese gardens also follow the principles of perspective of Japanese landscape painting, which feature a close-up plane, an intermediate plane, and a distant plane. The empty space between the different planes has a great importance, and is filled with water, moss, or sand. The garden designers used various optical tricks to give the garden the illusion of being larger than it really is, by borrowing of scenery ("shakkei"), employing distant views outside the garden, or using miniature trees and bushes to create the illusion that they are far away.
Zen gardens are uniquely symbolic landscapes that can reflect your inner artistry, as well as provide you with a meditative experience. These arrangements are more than just beautiful ‚Äì they‚Äôre functional!
Zen gardens are sometimes better known as Japanese rock gardens. These stylized, dry landscapes are mainly composed of rocks, moss, pruned trees and bushes, and layers of gravel or sand carefully raked to represent the flow of water.
The lack of plants around this garden is meant to emphasize the spiritual importance of the way you arrange the rocks, trees, moss, and gravel or sand. As a plus, this means far less maintenance for you than with typical gardens.
The placement of these objects is deeply rooted in Zen Buddhist teachings and philosophies, many of which date back centuries ago. Let‚Äôs take a closer look at that.
Zen gardens were first created in Zen Buddhist temples in Kyoto, Japan, during the Muromachi Period.
These gardens were essentially shallow sandboxes filled to the brim with either sand or gravel and later decorated with larger rocks of various shapes and sizes.
Put together, the large rocks and surrounding sand or gravel are meant to represent islands in the sea.
The upkeep of the sand or gravel is an especially important process. Creating the impression of ocean waves through raking is often used as an aid to meditation, especially about the true meaning of life.
As such, keeping a zen garden was meant to be a highly spiritual experience, and it is still considered one today.
The selection and placement of your larger rocks is ‚Äì by far ‚Äì the most important part of creating a Japanese rock garden.
In fact, there are certain rules you must follow in order to respect this ancient gardening tradition.
Choosing Stones
The first known manual of Japanese gardening is called the Sakuteiki (or ‚ÄúRecords of Garden Making‚Äù). It laid out very specific rules for choosing and placing stones in a zen garden, warning those that do not heed these rules will suffer great misfortune.
Rocks are typically classified as either tall vertical, low vertical, arching, reclining, or flat among Japanese gardeners. These classifications are made to symbolize different aspects of nature, which will be further discussed in the ‚ÄúZen Rock Garden‚Äù section below.
The type of rock chosen is just as vital as its shape. For instance, you must use igneous rocks, or rough mountain rocks that have sharp edges, to symbolize mountains. The borders of your Japanese zen garden should be smooth sedimentary rocks to keep in the gravel or sand.
The Sakuteiki also states that your stones should:
Vary in color, shape, and size from one another.
Not have bright colors that could distract the viewer from the whole picture.
Have grains that generally run in the same direction.
Placing Stones
Once you have chosen your rocks, you need to be very careful about their placement around your garden. The harmony of the overall rock composition is meant to give its owner a sense of peace and tranquility.
All your stones must be placed with their best sides shown at all times and at all angles. This means that if a stone has an ugly-looking top, you must place it in a way that hides that fault, even if it leans at an odd angle.
Stones are rarely placed in simple, straight lines or in symmetrical patterns around your typical zen garden. The most common rock arrangement consists of a single group or even several groups ‚Äì of three rocks each.
Many Buddhists place two small rocks on either side of a tall vertical rock to represent Buddha and his two attendants. However, the placement of rocks is not as rigid as these rules would have you believe.
A new ‚Äúrule‚Äù was invented at the end of the Edo period: suteishi, which are discarded or ‚Äúnameless‚Äù rocks placed at random to add a sense of spontaneity to the garden.
Adding Plants
Plants must be kept to an absolute minimum in a zen garden, as the emphasis is more on the stones and their placement around the garden.
Zen Rock Garden
The symbolism behind the stones is one of the most important (if not the most important) design elements in the creation of a Japanese rock garden.
Vertical stones (or taido rocks) are often used to represent trees (or the element of wood).
Flat, horizontal stones (or shintai rocks) represent flowing water.
Arching stones (or shigyo rocks) represent fire.
Low or reclining stones (or reisho and kikyaku rocks respectively) represent metal and the earth.
Feel free to experiment with different combinations, such as:
A tall vertical rock (wood) with a reclining rock (earth).
A short vertical rock (metal) and a flat rock (water).
A tall vertical rock (wood), a reclining rock (earth), and a flat rock (water).
Whichever arrangement you choose, just be sure that you balance the number of vertical and horizontal rocks in your zen garden.
You can also use your large stones to mimic other natural formations.
Karetaki
Your zen garden should absolutely lack a pond or body of water. If you really want to include a water-like feature, then you can design a karetaki, or dry waterfall.
All that‚Äôs necessary is to arrange your stones and sand or gravel into a waterfall-like shape. Typically, the waterfall‚Äôs cascade is represented through a tall, standing bluestone.
You can then create a karenagare, or raked sand river, to mimic a stream at the base of your waterfall.
Karesansui: Rock Sculptures
Depending on the size of your stone, you can use it to symbolize a mountain, an island, or a welcoming post if it‚Äôs placed at the entrance of your garden.
You can also create a kogetsudai, or gravel mountain, out of gravel or sand by shaping the substrate into a tall cone to represent Mount Fuji (or another mountain).
You can also create a simple bridge or pathway made of stone through your garden. This path can add a sense of distance to your zen garden, and you can use them as a focal point to aid meditation as well.
While most people may think all zen gardens must be grand, sweeping places, this is actually incorrect. Zen gardens are refuges unrestricted to their size or location, and can, in fact, be any size the owner wants ‚Äì so long as it provides them some form of peace in that space.
Even keeping a mini zen garden on your desk may help increase your concentration and reduce stress.
You might be unable to place as many stones or plants in this smaller zen garden, but arranging your chosen flora and stones, as well as drawing new patterns in your gravel or sand, can be just as meditative as keeping a much larger garden.
In fact, this tiny garden could be just the solace you need from an overwhelming workload throughout the day.
Zen Sand Garden
Using sand as opposed to gravel in your zen garden can create an interesting symbolic contrast.
The fluid quality of sand expresses a sense of changeability that juxtaposes the solid, timelessness of stone. It can also symbolize an empty mind (as opposed to one full of negative thoughts), or, when raked in swirls, represent how water laps at the edges of stones and islands.
Depending on how they are raked, these swirls can depict either raging or gentle waves. In much broader terms, sand may also symbolize the ocean surrounding the island of Japan.
In essence, a zen sand garden provides an interesting aesthetic, as well as a tangible balance to the rigidity of stones you choose to use.
How to Make a Zen Garden
While zen gardens may look simple to create and maintain, they are anything but. They may seem low-maintenance on the surface, due to the lack of plants, but the raking process (especially for those who opt to use sand over gravel substrate) requires a surprising amount of concentration and skill.
There‚Äôs no mandatory upkeep, but the meaning behind these gardens lends itself to hard work.
This is also not a garden for those who want to grow more extravagant flora or keep much flora in general. Do keep these details in mind before you commit to developing a giant zen garden in your backyard.
Supplies and Materials
Tape measure.
Fencing (optional).
Shovel.
Stakes.
String.
String level.
Steel garden rake.
Tamper.
Edging stones.
Rocks of various sizes and shapes.
White gravel or sand.
Wooden Zen rake.
Hoe.
Landscape fabric.
Method
Mark a rectangular, flat area in your backyard to create your zen garden. A 12 x 18-foot rectangle may suffice on a smaller property. You must also take into account the appropriate sunlight and watering requirements of your plants if you plan to grow some in your garden as well.
A traditional zen garden is a walled-in space due to its personal, meditative nature. Most people, however, might not want to construct a large stone wall just for this one spot. In that case, you can invest in some cheaper lattice fencing instead, so as to achieve nearly the same effect. Of course, this would then be a separate project you need to undertake before you start on your zen garden, so be sure you plan your time accordingly. Just be sure your resulting gate is wide enough for you to bring your zen garden supplies in later.
Clear your rectangular space of any plants, weeds, stones, or other debris in the way.
Use your shovel to remove a few inches of soil from your marked area.
Hammer your stakes into the ground at each corner, tying your string between them to check the level with your sting level.
Use the steel garden rake to rake out any uneven spots until the ground is flat.
Tamp down the soil.
Place your edging stones. These stones will keep your gravel or sand inside.
If you plan to use any large stones, or compile your gravel or sand together to represent mountains or islands, then be sure you dig a large enough hole for each ‚Äúmountain‚Äù or ‚Äúisland‚Äù you erect. You should also dig holes for any plants you install.
Place your larger rocks and plants in their respective holes. The ‚Äúmountain‚Äù rocks should be buried most of the way in the hole.
Place your landscape fabric over the soil. Make sure you cut holes in the fabric to accommodate your ‚Äúmountain‚Äù rocks and plants.
Arrange your rocks together in a way you like best.
Scatter a few inches of your gravel or sand, using your hoe to distribute it evenly. Finally, you can use your wooden Zen rake to create patterns in the substrate.
According to the Sakuteiki, the earliest surviving manual for Japanese garden design, one must first acquire an overall "feeling of the place" before arranging rocks onto a landscape. What does the scenery around it look like? What is its natural aesthetic mood? It's important to keep in mind that nature itself is a consummate artist. Even though we are modifying nature to suit our personal preference, we should still consider the fundamental atmosphere of the whole place.
The number of rocks used in a Zen garden varies, depending on the intention of each landscaper. The majestic rock garden at Ryoan-ji, for instance, contains only fifteen rocks and no shrubs, leaving a long stretch of empty space carpeted with grayish gravel. All of the rocks are of similar colors, and none has any distinctive features. Many have tried to decode this simplistic yet enigmatic arrangement, and there are more than a dozen well-known interpretations. One of the most popular theories is that the creator of the Ryoan-ji garden didn't intend to replicate an abstract version of a pond garden at all. Rather, the five groups of rocks in this garden stand for the five primordial elements: wood, fire, earth, metal and water. By contrast with the garden of Ryoan-ji, the one at Daisen-in, a sub temple of Daitoku-ji, is much smaller in size but has about a hundred rocks in it. Each rock was meticulously selected on account of its size, shade and figurative shape. For example, an oblong flat rock on a wavy sand pattern evokes the image of a ship sailing in the sea, while a small round stone next to an erect jagged rock reminds us of a turtle at the foot of a mountain.
You may create a rock garden similar to the one at Ryoan-ji if you want to give your landscape an airy and minimalistic feel. Or you may build one with multiple rocks of various shapes and sizes if you prefer your rock garden to appear more artistic and explicit like the Daisen-in garden. There is no right or wrong, no better or worse, in the art of Zen gardens. Whether you use fifteen or a hundred rocks, your Zen garden would still serve its purpose of bringing you closer to nature and peace. In case you have no idea where to start, think of a natural landscape or scenery that has a special meaning to you, and allow it to be your source of inspiration. Consider the positions of the main rocks or the bigger elements first, and the rest will naturally fall into place.
Since sunlight and water don't matter to it, a mini Zen garden might be an excellent choice for those who don't have a backyard but would like to bring some nature into their home. Many websites and gift shops provide indoor Zen-garden kits containing a mini wooden rake, a small bag of sand, a wooden tray and an assortment of rocks. The prices usually range from $10 - $30 for tabletop-size ones. If you're inclined to exercise your creativity, you can also build your own indoor Zen garden from scratch. First, you have to pick a frame for your rock garden. Any type of shallow container will work. You may use a wooden serving tray, a shallow soup plate, a cardboard box or even a photo frame. As for decorative rocks and sand, you can buy them at a hardware store, art-supply shop or a department store that sells home d√©cor items. Garden-supply stores may offer a larger variety of these materials, yet they don't always sell them in small quantities. And last but not least, you also need a mini rake. On Amazon.com, they are sold at about $3 each. If you have a nice wooden fork or a small back scratcher, however, you may use that as a rake instead of buying a proper one. As mentioned earlier, there is no right or wrong in the art of Zen rock gardens, and that also applies to the miniature versions. You can be as innovative and resourceful as you'd like.

Although Zen Buddhism eventually developed traditions of study and ritual, its emphasis on personal experience has always made it a practice-oriented tradition. The practice is meditation. ‚ÄúSitting Zen‚Äù (Japanese: zazen) has always been central in Zen training centers, where monks rise early each morning for meditation practice and do long retreats consisting of many, many silent unmoving hours on the cushion.
What is Zazen? It literally means ‚Äúsitting Zen.‚Äù Put simply, it‚Äôs ‚Äúseated meditation‚Äù as done in the Zen style ‚Äî upright in good posture, paying careful attention to breathing in your belly until you are fully alert and present.
Zazen is an intensely simple practice. It is generally taught without steps, stages, or frills. ‚ÄúJust sit!‚Äù the master admonishes, by which he or she means, sit upright in good posture, paying careful attention to breathing in your belly until you are fully alert and present. This sense of being present, with illumination and intensity, is the essence of zazen, and although there are many approaches to Zen meditation, they all come back to this.
Zen monk meditating.
In the Zen monastery, life is entirely organized around sitting in the meditation hall. But zazen is also understood to be something more than this sitting. It is conceived of as a state of mind or being that extends into all activities. Work is zazen; eating is zazen; sleeping, walking, standing, going to the toilet ‚Äî all are zazen practice. In Soto Zen, the Japanese school practiced extensively in the West, there is an especially strong emphasis on this ‚Äúmoving Zen.‚Äù Soto monastic life tends to be highly ritualized, so as to promote concentration in all things. There is, for instance, a special elegant and mindful practice, called oryoki, for eating ritualized meals in the meditation hall.
KOAN PRACTICE
In koan Zen, contemplation of a koan begins with zazen practice. The practitioner comes to intense presence with body and breath, and then brings up the koan almost as a physical object, repeating it over and over again with breathing, until words and meaning dissolve and the koan is ‚Äúseen.‚Äù
This practice is usually done in the context of an intensive retreat led by a qualified Zen koan teacher, whom the practitioner visits for private interviews. The student presents their understanding of the koan (however lame it may be) and receives a response from the teacher (however understated it may be) that reorients the search.
Eventually, with luck, diligence and a few judicious hints, the koan‚Äôs essence is penetrated.
Like all systems, the koan system can degenerate into a self-protective and self-referential enclosure. It‚Äôs the teacher‚Äôs job to see that this doesn‚Äôt happen, but sometimes it is not preventable. There are many different systems of koan study, but most of them emphasize humor, spontaneity, and openness. The koan method is, at its best, a unique and marvelous expression of human religious sensibility.
How did Zen Buddhism come to be?
Through the centuries, India, the first Buddhist country, gradually spawned hundreds of sects and sub-sects, and thousands of scriptures, and tens of thousands of commentaries on those scriptures. When Buddhism spread over Central Asian trade routes to China, all this material came at once. The Chinese had long cherished their own twin traditions of Confucianism and Taoism and were resistant to ideologies introduced by barbarians from beyond the borders of the ‚ÄúMiddle Kingdom.‚Äù There was also a severe linguistic challenge for the Chinese in digesting the Buddhist message from abroad. The Sanskrit language was so different from Chinese in sensibility and syntax that translation was almost impossible.
Gradually, Indian and Central Asian Buddhism began to be reshaped by its encounter with Chinese culture. This reshaping eventually led to the creation of Zen, an entirely new school of Buddhism, which eventually became by far the most successful school of Buddhism in China, Korea, Japan and Vietnam.
Schools of Zen Buddhism
Zen schools are more or less divisible into those that emphasize a curriculum of verbal meditation objects ‚Äî like koans ‚Äî and those that do not.
Emphasizing daily life practice as zazen, Soto Zen centers generally do not work with a set koan curriculum and method, though koans are studied and contemplated. Because of this, Soto Zen has sometimes been criticized by the koan schools (the best-known of which is the Rinzai school of Japan) as dull, overly precious, and quietistic, in contrast to the dynamic and lively engagement of the koan path. But the koan way also has its critics, who see the emphasis on words, meaning, and insight as working against real non-conceptual Zen living. Koan training systems also have the disadvantage of fostering competition and obsession with advancement in the system.
It is remarkable how essentially similar the various teachers within a particular Zen ‚Äúdharma family‚Äù can be in personal style and mode of expression, even though, paradoxically, each one is quite distinctive and individualistic.
Zen Buddhism has had a long and varied history in several different Far Eastern cultures. Each culture has produced a tradition that is recognizable as Zen, but differs slightly from all the others. Vietnamese Zen is the one most influenced by the Theravada tradition. It tends to be gentle in expression and method, to emphasize purity and carefulness, and to combine Zen with some Theravada teaching and methodology.
In China, Zen eventually became the only Buddhist school, inclusive of all the others, so contemporary Ch‚Äôan includes many faith-based Mahayana practices that existed initially in other Buddhist schools, especially faith in and repetition of the name of Amida Buddha, the savior Buddha who will ensure rebirth in an auspicious heaven to those who venerate him.
Especially stylized, dramatic, and austere, Korean Zen includes prostration practice (repeated, energetic full-to-the-floor bows of veneration) and intensive chanting practice, and has a hermit tradition, something virtually unknown in Japanese Zen.
Within each of the Asian Zen traditions there are several schools, and within schools the styles of individual teachers often differ greatly. Still, it is remarkable how essentially similar the various teachers within a particular Zen ‚Äúdharma family‚Äù can be in personal style and mode of expression, even though, paradoxically, each one is quite distinctive and individualistic. This uncanny fact ‚Äî radical individuality within the context of shared understanding ‚Äî seems to be an indelible feature of Zen.
B-lEFORE proceeding to expound the teaching of Zen at some
length in the following pages, let me answer some of the questions which are frequently raised by critics concerning the real nature of Zen.
Is Zen a system of philosophy, highly intellectual and
profoundly metaphysical, as most Buddhist teachings are?
I have already stated that we find in Zen all the philosophy
of the East crystallized, but this ought not to be taken as meaning
that Zen is a philosophy in the ordinary application of the term. Zen is decidedly not a system founded upon logic and
analysis. If anything, it is the antipode to logic, by which I mean the dualistic mode of thinking. There may be an in- tellectual element in Zen, for Zen is the whole mind, and in
it we find a great many things; but the mind is not a composite thing that is to be divided into so many faculties, leaving
nothing behind when the dissection is over. Zen has nothing to teach us in the way of intellectual analysis ; nor has it any set doctrines which are imposed on its followers for acceptance. In
this respect Zen is quite chaotic if you choose to say so. Probably Zen followers may have sets of doctrines, but they have
them on their own account, and for their own benefit; they do
not owe the fact to Zen. Thereore, there are in Zen no sacred books or dogmatic tenets, nor are there any symbolic formulae through which an access might be gained into the signification of Zen. If I am asked, then, what Zen teaches, I would answer, Zen teaches nothing. Whatever teachings there are in Zen,
they come out of one's own mind. We teach ourselves; Zen
merely points the way. Unless this pointing is teaching, there is certainly nothing in Zen purposely set up as its cardinal doctrines or as its fundamental philosophy.
Zen claims to be Buddhism, but all the Buddhist teachings
as propounded in the sutras and sastras are treated by Zen as mere waste paper whose utility consists in wiping off the dirt of intellect and nothing more. Do not imagine, however, that Zen
is nihilism. All nihilism is self-destructive, it ends nowhere.
Negativism is sound as method, but the highest truth is an
affirmation. When it is said that Zen has no philosophy, that it denies all doctrinal authority, that it casts aside all so-called sacred literature as rubbish, we must not forget that Zen is holding up in this very act of negation something quite positive
and eternally affirmative. This will become clearer as we proceed.
Is Zen a religion? It is not a religion in the sense that the term is popularly understood; for Zen has no God to worship, no ceremonial rites to observe, no future abode to which the dead are destined, and, last of all, Zen has no soul whose welfare is to be looked after by somebody else and whose immortality is a matter of intense concern wdth some people. Zen is free from all these dogmatic and "religious" encumbrances.
When I say there is no God in Zen, the pious reader may
be shocked, but this does not mean that Zen denies the existence of God ; neither denial nor affirmation concerns Zen. When a
thing is denied, the very denial involves something not denied. The same can be said of affirmation. This is inevitable in logic.
Zen wants to rise above logic, Zen wants to find a higher affir- mation where there are no antitheses. Therefore, in Zen, God
is neither denied nor insisted upon; only there is in Zen no such
God as has been conceived by Jewish and Christian minds. For the same reason that Zen is not a philosophy, Zen is not a
religion.
As to all those images of various Buddhas and Bodhisattvas
and Devas and other beings that one comes across in Zen
temples, they are like so many pieces of wood or stone or metal;
they are like the camellias, azalias, or stone lanterns in my
garden. Make obeisance to the camellia now in full bloom, and
worship it if you like, Zen would say. There is as much religion in so doing as in bowing to the various Buddhist gods, or as sprinkling holy water, or as participating in the Lord's Supper.
All those pious deeds considered to be meritorious or sanctifying
by most so-called religiously minded people are artificialities in the eyes of Zen. It boldly declares that "the immaculate Yogins
do not enter Nirvana and the precept-violating monks do not gc to hell". This, to ordinary minds, is a contradiction of the common law of moral life, but herein lies the truth and life of Zen. Zen is the spirit of a man. Zen believes in his inner purity
and goodness. Whatever is superadded or violendy torn away,
injures the wholesomeness of the spirit. Zen, therefore, is emphatically against all religious conventionalism.
Its irreligion, however, is merely apparent. Those who are
truly religious will be surprised to find that after all there b so much of religion in the barbarous declaration of Zen. But to say that Zen is a religion, in the sense that Christianity or Mohammedanism is, would be a mistake. To make my point
clearer, I quote the following. When Sakyamuni was bom, it is said that he lifted one hand toward the heavens and pointed
to the earth with the other, exclaiming, "Above the heavens and
below the heavens, I alone am the Honoured One!" Ummon (Yun-men), founder of the Ummon School of Zen, comments on this by saying, "If I had been wth him at the moment of his uttering this, I would surely have struck him dead with one blow and thrown the corpse into the maw of a hungry dog."
What unbelievers would ever think of making such raving remarks over a spiritual leader? Yet one of the Zen masters
following Ummon says : "Indeed, this is the way Ummon desires to ser\e the world, sacrificing everything he has, body and
mind ! How grateful he must have felt for the love of Buddha!"
Zen is not to be confounded with a form of meditation as practised by "New Thought" people, or Christian Scientists, or Hindu Sannyasins, or some Buddhists. Dhyana, as it is understood by Zen, does not correspond to the practice as carried on
in Zen. A man may meditate on a religious or philosophical
subject while disciplining himself in Zen, but that is only inci- dental ; the essence of Zen is not there at all. Zen purposes to
discipline the mind itself, to make it its own master, through an insight into its proper nature. This getting into the real nature of one's owm mind or soul is the fundamental object of Zen Buddhism. Zen, therefore, is more than meditation and
Dhyana in its ordinary sense. The discipline of Zen consists in opening the mental eye in order to look into the very reason
of existence. To meditate, a man has to fix his thought on something;
for instance, on the oneness of God, or his infinite love, or on the impermancnce of things. But this is the very thing Zen
desires to avoid. If there is anything Zen strongly emphasizes it is the attainment of freedom ; that is, freedom from all unnatural encumbrances. Meditation is something artificially put on ; it does not belong to the native activity of the mind. Upon
what do the fowl of the air meditate? Upon what do the fish in the water meditate? They fly ; they swim. Is not that enough?
Who wants to fix his mind on the unity of God and man, or on the nothingness of this life? WTio wants to be arrested in the
daily manifestations of his life-activity by such meditations as the goodness of a divine being or the everlasting fire of hell? We may say that Christianity is monotheistic, and the Vedanta pantheistic ; but we cannot make a similar assertion about Zen. Zen is neither monotheistic nor pantheistic; Zen
defies all such designations. Hence there is no object in Zen upon which to fix the thought. Zen is a wafting cloud in the sky. No
screw fastens it, no string holds it; it moves as it lists. No amount of meditation will keep ^¬´n in one place. Meditation is not Zen,
Neither pantheism nor monotheism provides Zen with its subjects of concentration. If Zen is monotheistic, it may tell its followers to meditate on the oneness of things where all diflferences and inequalities, enveloped in the all-illuminating brightness of the
divine light, are obliterated. If Zen were pantheistic it would tell us that every meanest flower in the field reflects the glory of God.
But what Zen says is "After all things are reduced to oneness, where would that One be reduced?" Zen wants to have one's mind free and unobstructed ; even the idea of oneness or allness is a stumbling-block and a strangling snare which threatens the
original freedom of the spirit. Zen, therefore, does not ask us to concentrate our tZen, therefore, does not ask us to concentrate our thought on the idea that a dog is God, or that three pounds of flax are
divine. When Zen does this it commits itself to a definite system
of philosophy, and there is no more Zen. Zen just feels fire warm
and ice cold, because when it freezes we shiver and welcome fire. The feeling is all in all, as Faust declares ; all our theorization fails to touch reality. But "the feeling" here must be understood in
its deepest sense or in its purest form. Even to say that "This is the feeling" means that Zen is no more there. Zen defies all conceptmaking. That is why Zen is difficult to grasp. Whatever meditation Zen may propose, then, will be to take
things as they are, to consider snow white and the raven black. When we speak of meditation we in most cases refer to its abstract character; that is, meditation is known to be the concentration of the mind on some highly generalized proposition,
which is, in the nature of things, not always closely and directly
connected with the concrete affairs of life. Zen perceives or feels, and does not abstract nor meditate. Zen penetrates and is finaUy
lost in the immersion. Meditation, on the other hand, is out- spokenly dualisdc and consequendy inevitably superficial.
One critic^ regards Zen as "the Buddhist counterpart of the
'Spiritual Exercises' of St. Ignatius Loyala". The critic shows
a great inclination to find Christian analogies for things Buddhistic, and this is one of such instances. Those who have at all a dear understanding of Zen will at once see how wide of the mark
this comparison is. Even superficially speaking, there is not a shadow of similitude between the exercises of Zen and those proposed by the founder of the Society of Jesus. The contemplations and prayers of St. Ignatius are, from the Zen point of view, merely so many fabrications of the imagination elaborately woven for the benefit of the piously minded ; and in reality this
is like piling tiles upon tiles on one's head, and there is no true gain in the life of the spirit. We can say this, however, that those "Spiritual Exercises" in some ways resemble certain meditations of Hinayana Buddhism, such as the Five Mind-quieting
Methods, or the Nine Thoughts on Impurity, or the Six or Ten
Subjects of Memory.
Zen is sometimes made to mean "mind-murder and the curse of idle reverie". This is the statement of Griffis, the well-known
author of Religions of Japan.^ By "mind-murder" I do not know
what he really means, but does he mean that Zen kills the
activities of the mind by making one's thought fix on one thing, or by inducing sleep? Mr. Reischauer in his book^ almost endorses
this view of Griffis by asserting that Zen is "mystical self-intoxi- cation". Does he mean that Zen is intoxicated in the "Greater Seir*; so called, as Spinoza was intoxicated in God? Though
Mr. Reischauer is not quite clear as to the meaning of "intoxi- cation", he may think that Zen is unduly absorbed in the thought
of the "Greater Self" as the final reality in this world of particulars. It is amazing to see how superficial some of the uncritical observers of Zen are! In point of fact, Zen has no "mind" to murder; therefore, there is no "mind-murdering" in Zen. Zen
has again no "self" as something to which we can cling as a
refuge; therefore, in Zen again there is no "self" by which we may become intoxicated. The truth is, Zen is extremely elusive as far as its outward
aspects are concerned ; when you think you have caught a glimpse
of it, it is no more there ; from afar it looks so approachable, but
as soon as you come near it you see it even further away from you
than before. Unless, therefore, you devote some years of earnest study to the understanding of its primary principles, it is not
to be expected that you will begin to have a fair grasp of Zen."The way to ascend unto God is to descend into one's self
these are Hugo's words. "If thou wishest to search out the deep
things of God, search out the depths of thine own spirit" ; ‚Äîthis comes from Richard of St. Victor. When all these deep things are searched out there is after all no "self". Where you can
descend, there is no "spirit", no "God" whose depths are to be
fathomed. Why? Because Zen is a bottomless abyss. Zen declares,
though in a somewhat different manner: "Nothing really exists throughout the triple world ; where do you wish to see the mind
(or spirit = hsin)? The four elements are all empty in their ultimate nature; where could the Buddha's abode be?‚Äîbut lo! the truth is unfolding itself right before your eye. This is all there
is to it‚Äîand indeed nothing more !" A minute's hesitation and
Zen is irrevocably lost. All the Buddhas of the past, present, and
future may try to make you catch it once more, and yet it is a thousand miles away. "Mind-murder" and "self-intoxication", forsooth ! Zen has no time to bother itself with such criticisms. The critics may mean that the mind is hypnotized by Zen to a state of unconsciousness, and that when this obtains, the
favourite Buddhist doctrine of emptiness {sunjata) is realized,
where the subject is not conscious of an objective world or of himself, being lost in one vast emptiness, whatever this may be. This interpretation again fails to hit Zen aright. It is true that there are some such expressions in Zen as might suggest this kind
of interpretation, but to understand Zen we must make a leap
here. The "vast emptiness" must be traversed. The subject must
be awakened from a state of unconsciousness if he does not wish to be buried alive. Zen is attained only when "self-intoxication" is abandoned and the "drunkard" is really awakened to his deeper
self. If the mind is ever to be "murdered", leave the work in the hand of Zen ; for it is Zen that will restore the murdered and
lifeless one into a state of eternal life. "Be bom again, be awakened from the dream, rise from the death, O ye drunkards!"
Zen would exclaim. Do not try, therefore, to see Zen with the eyes bandaged; and your hands are too unsteady to take hold
of it. And remember I am not indulging in figures of speech.
I might multiply many such criticisms if it were necessary but I hope that the above have sufficiently prepared the reader's mind for the following more positive statements concerning Zen. The basic idea of Zen is to come in touch with the inner workings
of our being, and to do this in the most direct way possible,
without resorting to anything external or superadded. Therefore,
anything that has the semblance of an external authority is rejected by Zen. Absolute faith is placed in a man's own inner
being. For whatever authority there is in Zen, all comes from
within. This is true in the strictest sense of the word. Even the reasoning faculty is not considered final or absolute. On the
contrary, it hinders the mind from coming into the directest communication with itself The intellect accomplishes its mission |when it works as an intermediary, and Zen has nothing to do with
'an intermediary except when it desires to communicate itself to others. For this reason all the scriptures are merely tentative and
provisory; there is in them no finality. The central fact of life as it
is lived is what Zen aims to grasp, and this in the most direct and
most vital manner. Zen professes itself to be the spirit of Buddhism, but in fact it is the spirit of all religions and philosophies.
When Zen is thoroughly understood, absolute peace of mind is attained, and a man lives as he ought to live. What more may we
hope?
Some say that as Zen is admittedly a form of mysticism it
cannot claim to be unique in the history of religion. Perhaps so; but Zen is a mysticism of its own order. It is mystical in the sense
that the sun shines, that the flower blooms, that I hear at this moment somebody beating a drum in the street. If these are
mystical facts, Zen is brim-full of them. When a Zen master was
once asked what Zen was, he replied, "Your everyday thought."
Is this not plain and most straightforward? It has nothing to do
with any sectarian spirit. Christians as well as Buddhists can
practise Zen just as big fish and small fish are both contentedly
living in the same ocean. Zen is the ocean, Zen is the air, Zen is the mountain, Zen is thunder and lightning, the spring flower,
sxmimer heat, and winter snow ; nay, more than that, Zen is the man. With all the formalities, conventionalisms, and superadditions that Zen has accuimulated in its long history, its central fact
is very much alive. The special merit of Zen lies in this : that we
are still able to see into this ultimate fact withhout being biased by
anything.
As has been said before, what makes Zen unique as it is practised in Japan is its systematic training of the mind. Ordinary
mysticism has been too erratic a product and apart from one's ordinary life; this Zen has revolutionized. What was up in the heavens, Zen has brought down to earth. With the development
of Zen, mysticism has ceased to be mystical ; it is no more the spasmodic product of an abnormally endowed mind. For Zen
reveals itself in the most uninteresting and uneventful life of a
plain man of the street, recognizing the fact of living in the midst
of life as it b lived. Zen s^-stematically trains the mind to see this;
it opens a man's eye to the greatest mystery as it is daily and
hourly performed ; it enlarges the heart to embrace eternity of time and infinity of space in its every palpitation ; it makes us live in the world as if walking in the garden of Eden ; and all these
spiritual feats are accomplished vsithout resorting to any doctrines but by simply asserting in the most direct way the truth that lies in our inner being.
Wliatever else Zen may be, it is practical and commonplace
and at the same time most living. An ancient master, wishing to show what Zen is, lifted one of his fingers, another kicked a ball, and a third slapped the face of his questioner. If the inner truth
that lies deep in us is thus demonstrated, is not Zen the most
practical and direct method of spiritual training ever resorted to by any religion? And is not this practical method also a most
original one? Indeed, Zen cannot be anything else but original
and creative because it refuses to deal with concepts but deals with
hving facts of life. When conceptually understood, the lifting of a finger is one of the most ordinary incidents in everybody's life. But when it is viewed from the Zen point of view it vibrates with
divine meaning and creative vitality. So long as Zen can point out this truth in the midst of our conventional and conceptbound existence we must say that it has its reason of being.
The following quotation fi-om a letter of Yengo (Yuan-wu in C. 1 566- 1 642) may answer, to a certain extent, the question asked in the beginning of this chapter, "What is Zen?"
"It is presented right to your face, and at this moment the whole thing is handed over to you. For an intelligent fellow, one word should suffice to convince him of the truth of it, but even
then error has crept in. Much more so when it is committed to paper and ink, or given up to wordy demonstration or to logical
quibble, then it slips farther away from you. The great truth of Zen ia possessed by everybody. Look into your own being and
seek it not through others. Your own mind is above all forms ; it is free and quiet and sufficient ; it eternally stamps itself in your six senses and four elements. In its light all is absorbed. Hush the dualism of subject and object, forget both, transcend the intellect, sever yourself from the understanding, and directly penetrate deep
into the identity of the Buddha-mind ; outside of this there are no
reahties. Therefore, when Bodhidharma came from the West,
he simply declared, 'Directly pointing to one's own soul, my
doctrine is unique, and is not hampered by the canonical
teachings; it is the absolute transmission of the true seal.' Zen has nothing to do with letters, words, or sutras. It only requests you
to grasp the point directly and therein to find your peaceful abode. When the mind is disturbed, the understanding is stirred, things are recognized, notions are entertained, ghostly spirits are conjured, and prejudices grow rampant. Zen will then forever be
lost in the maze. "The wise Sekiso (Shih-shuang) said, 'Stop all your hankerings; let the mildew grow on your lips; make yourself like unto
a perfect piece of inMnaculatc silk; let your one thought be eternity; let yourself be like dead ashes, cold and lifeless; again
let yourself be like an old censer in a deserted village shrine !' "Putting your simple faith in this, discipline yourself accordingly; let your body and mind be turned into an inanimate
object of nature like a stone or a piece of wood; when a state of
perfect motionlessness and unawareness is obtained all the signs of life will depart and also every trace of limitation will vanish. Not a single idea will disturb your consciousness, when lo ! all of a sudden you will come to realize a light abounding in full gladness. It is like coming across a light in thick darkness; it is like receiving treasure in poverty. The four elements and the five aggregates are no more felt as burdens ; so light, so easy, so free you are. Your very existence has been delivered from all limitations ; you have become open, light, and transparent. You gain an
illuminating insight into the very nature of things, which now
appear to you as so many fairylike flowers having no graspable
realities. Here is manifested the unsophisticated self which is the
original face of your being; here is shown all bare the most
beautiful landscape of your birthplace. There is but one straight passage open and unobstructed through and through. This is so when you surrender all‚Äîyour body, your life, and all that belongs
to your inmost self. This is where you gain peace, ease, nondoing, and inexpressible delight. All the sutras and sastras are no more than communications of this fact ; all the sages, ancient as well as modern, have exhausted their ingenuity and imagination
to no other purpose than to point the way to this. It is like unlocking the door to a treasury; when the entrance is once
gained, every object coming into your view is yours, every opportunity that presents itself is available for your use ; for are they not, however multitudinous, all possessions obtainable
within the original being of yourself? Every treasure there is but
waiting your pleasure and utilization. This is what is meant by
'Once gained, eternally gained, even unto the end of time.' Yet
really there is nothing gained ; what you have gained is no gain,
and yet there is something truly gained in this."
Imitate nature
The significance of gardens for the Japanese comes from ancient religious beliefs and a deep respect for nature. This reverence is reflected by the design of the garden, which is supposed to look like the outside world, just on a smaller scale.
Japanese landscape designer Shiro Nakane restores historic gardens in Japan and creates new ones as well by following the traditional principles. He tells Architectural Digest the goal is ‚Äúnot to make a new nature but to make a copy of existing, desirable nature.‚Äù
Anything that would be found in nature can be integrated into the design. Nakane has drawn his designs from large geographical elements, such as Mount Fuji and Niagara Falls.
Symbolism
Since most Japanese gardens are found in smaller, enclosed spaces and their inspiration is much larger, it is crucial to shrink the size of the elements used.
Boulders become mountains and pools represent lakes. Most flat garden designs use gravel to symbolize water. The landscape is supposed to be a microcosm of the greater world beyond, so even bonsai trees can represent fully grown trees.
Nakane points out that even though the garden is supposed look natural, each detail is carefully considered.
‚ÄúRock arrangement is a bit like choreography,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIt can take an hour to twist and turn it until it‚Äôs placed right.‚Äù
Most Japanese gardens are enclosed with fences to further the concept of their being miniature worlds of their own. However, when the opportunity presents itself, outside views can be incorporated as well.
Having an open gate that can frame the desired vista connects the outside world with the inner reflective space of the garden. The borrowed view can be a distant mountain or a tree just beyond the fence. These natural features are incorporated as part of the garden‚Äôs design.
By integrating these outer elements, the ambiance and spirit of the location is captured.
Japanese gardening is an intricate process and it is often said the design is never finished because, like nature, it is always changing.
Zen Buddhism is dedicated to the study of nature and humanity's place in the world. Japanese Zen gardens capture the philosophy of making a peaceful way. Attaining enlightenment by regular practice of Buddhist concepts may be doable, but for those who need a moment now and then in serene places to invigorate the soul, few places can match the setting of a Japanese garden. Within its boundaries, rock, stone, plants and water combine to still the mind.
Ishi
Mountains, Buddha and worship are suggested by the use of stones.
Rocks, or ishi, are foundational items in Japanese gardens. They typically represent mountains, but may also symbolize the figure of Buddha, or a gesture of strength and power. At many gardens, the entries are marked by a large stone, as a sign of welcome. Stones figure into the water elements and are sometimes used in forming paths. When water is not available, sand or small white pebbles are substituted to symbolize the space often held by water.
Mizu
Water is the purifying element but also can suggest space and time.
A vital element to life, mizu, or the water element, is found as ponds, streams, and waterfalls. Sometimes a small fountain designates the water element. Water is for purification and cleansing. When peering at or walking beside a pond in a Zen garden, the stillness and empty space are important for reflection in a literal sense. Meditation is the literal meaning of the word Zen, and water is a superb conduit for such practice. Falls have several symbolic overtures, and dripping indicates the passage of time.
Shokobutsu
The form and layout of plants must create a satisfying panorama.
Care is given in selecting the plantings, or shokobutsu, for a Japanese garden. Cherry trees, with their delicate pink flowers in spring, are a well-loved feature tree. Also often found are plum trees, different pines and bamboo. The sound of wind in bamboo and its motion teach the Zen principle of the "empty heart," providing strength through flexibility. The layout and groupings of plants must be subtle and pleasing, all year round.
Tenkeibutsu
Garden ornaments may include lamps, lanterns, frogs, fish or other statuary.
Lanterns are used as symbols of enlightenment. They are one form of tenkeibutsu, or ornamentation. Others might include frogs, basins and gates. Statues of the Buddha may be present, or of other deities, and a garden's teahouse might have a painting of carp or mandalas. Deeply traditional gardens will keep ornamentation to a minimum, and every item has a clear purpose.
Shakkei
The garden designers incorporated a distant view behind a teahouse.
To support the interconnectedness of all in existence, shakkei, or borrowing pre-existing scenery, is applied. The garden itself takes up a certain amount of land, but beyond its perimeter there might be hills or valleys, or something to frame with plants or structures within the garden's walls. The attentive garden designer will seek out how to blend with the near, far, high and low surroundings proportionately and gracefully.
Hashi
Bridges, or hashi, symbolize the journey between planes, and between worlds.
Hashi, or bridges, are constructed in the Zen garden to symbolize a person's journey between the planes of existence, the inner and outer, the multiple dimensions beyond and the place that lies between worlds. Man's unity with nature can be symbolized by his simple walking across a bridge to move from the world of humans into the wider world of all forms and beings. For the visitor to any Japanese garden, the bridge and all other elements present, may simply allow a moment of harmony and appreciation for what is.
One of the characteristics of the Japanese garden is the use of stone as a major component of landscapes created in a garden context. Since the very earliest dates of creating gardens in Japan (8th century), stones and their placement has been an important element. Given that the original inspiration for creating gardens came into Japan from China it is not great surprise, as stones have always held a dominant position in the Chinese garden culture. In both China and Japan gardens are recreations of landscape, or at least the attempt to create something of the perceived ‚Äòessence‚Äô of landscape. The term for landscape in Chinese is  shansui, Â±±Ê∞¥ (sansui in Japanese); this is composed of two characters, the first reading ‚Äòmountain‚Äô, and the second ‚Äòwater‚Äô. Thus the essence of landscape is encapsulated by the concept of ‚Äòmountains and water‚Äô. It is interesting to note in passing that the dominant element in the composition of Chinese landscape paintings are also mountains and mountain scenery. From a cursory glance it can easily be appreciated that the two principal components of a Japanese garden are indeed mountains (as represented by stones) and water (either real or symbolic).
Even today in the field of creating traditional gardens in Japan the setting of stones, ishigumi, Áü≥ÁµÑ, is regarded as a measure of the ultimate skill of a garden creator. Stones are accorded an almost reverential quality in the garden, and a great deal of care is taken in the selection and placement of stones. They are regarded as forming the essential skeleton of the garden, providing the garden layout with a fixed and subtle framework that will define the overall structure of the garden. Planting, that element of a garden so revered by Western garden makers, tends to be seen as adding flesh to the bones of a garden. In the East planting is complimentary to stone settings but ultimately subservient to the importance of stone arrangement. Perhaps this occurs because stones are perceived as adding a sense of permanence to a garden, whereas plants can be subject to an observable process of change and growth in the short term.
The types of stone used in Japanese gardens vary considerably in geological and mineral makeup. The choice of stones depends on availability and the intuitive sensibility of the garden creator. Stones with a provenience that may come from the status of previous owners are sought after and are considered highly desirable, also stones displaying eccentric forms are sometimes be used and can also be highly regarded.
Broadly, stones used in Japanese gardens can be classified into five basic types: 
Tall vertical; this is a stone taller than it is broad. It will stand upright, and very often be the focal point of a group. Can stand 0.9m (3‚Äô) or more from the ground.
Low vertical; much the same as above in essence, but a shorter piece. Generally below 0.9m (3‚Äô) in height.
Inclining; this refers to stones that have a pronounced diagonal form. They may incline left to right or right to left. Inclining stones are often used as support pieces in triadic groups.
Reclining; this refers to stone that seem to arch from the ground in a more or less symmetrical manner, that is without a pronounced inclination to the left or right side.
Horizontal: this refers to stones that sit low and flat to the ground, with a top that has a defined horizontal plane. Stepping-stones are an example of these stones.
In assessing and choosing stones the garden creator needs to establish the inherent form of a stone, and in doing so gains an idea of how each stone is to be set. Every stone will have its own way to be arranged, this is determined by identifying the ‚Äòhead‚Äô or top of the stone, the ‚Äòface‚Äô or aspect of the stone deemed to have most aesthetic appeal, and the ‚Äòroot‚Äô or that portion of the stone to be set into the ground. In the Sakuteiki[1] clear advice is given into stone setting: ‚ÄúWhen setting stones, first bring a number of different stones, both large and small, to the garden site and temporarily set them out on the ground‚Ä¶. Compare the various qualities of the stones and, keeping the overall garden plan in mind, pull the stones into place one by one.‚Äù        
Stones have a dynamic visual energy within them. That is they are not regarded as being simply inert bodies occupying space. The overall shape of the stone, their texture and markings all give a sense of the energy that they are able to express. The stone illustrated below is a tall upright piece, looked at carefully it can be noted that particularly in the lower third of its bulk the graining of the stone has a sense of diagonal movement from right to left rising to the top left shoulder. Also looking at the overall bulk of the stone there is a subtle shift of weight that runs first diagonally from left to right, then shifts to run right to left to the top or head of the stone. These two ‚Äòmovements‚Äô within the stone are complimentary and give a rising feeling to the stone. The stone in question stands about 1.5 m (5 feet) from ground level and this bulk combined with its encapsulated sense of movement gives the stone a feeling of power and presence.
In the second stone illustrated, the overall shape of the stone is dominated by the rising shoulder running from right to left. In this stone the grain runs almost vertically from the ground upwards with light and darker minerals creating interesting vertical bands. Here the sharp contrast in the angle of the inclined shoulder and the vertical bands again compliment one another giving an added strength to the stone‚Äôs visual appearance. This stone would not necessarily make a dominant stone in an arrangement, but would set well as a supporting stone, set to the right hand side of a tall upright, so that the inclined shoulder points towards the top of an upright stone.
In a garden at Nanzen-ji temple, Kyoto can be found two fine examples of the use of reclining stones. The second stone (from the left) that is set low to the ground plane provides a visual link between the two larger stones set closer to the wall, it also has the function of emphasizing the bulk and height of the stones to the rear, as well as creating a sense of depth in the relationship between the three stones. Further to the right another reclining stone is also placed to the fore of the arrangement, which also functions in much the same way. A reclining stone does not draw particular attention to itself, but serves in a subordinate role, one that can be vital to an arrangement nevertheless.
In creating a group of stones it is usual to first set in place a stone that acts as a dominant stone in an arrangement. This will often be a tall upright stone set in the background of the overall plan, each subsequent stone set will then refer visually back to the dominant stone. In this way the entire arrangement is tied together into a logical and harmonious entirety. Stones are rarely set in isolation, but most commonly arranged in triadic compositions. This is true of both individual stones creating a group, as well as groups of stones set across the entire scheme. In both cases it is important that individual stones and groups relate to one another in a harmonious manner. In Japan this spatial arrangement is commonly found in all the visual arts (such as painting and flower arrangement) and is known as ≈çshakei. The three elements of ≈çshakei are referred to as Heaven, Man and Earth; Heaven being the vertical dimension, Man the diagonal, and Earth the horizontal. Heaven expresses a quality of aspiration, Man the quality of dynamism and Earth the quality of stability. Vertical and horizontal forces are ‚Äòfixed‚Äô in the sense that they require the completion of the triad‚Äôs third element to provide a sense of implied dynamic movement. Where only two of the three elements are present then the fundamental opposition of the forces involved acts to cancel each other out, and the result can be a state of stasis or lack of movement. Most stone groups are composed with an uneven number of elements, the numbers three, five and seven being the most common. The reason for this is that even numbers are considered to be static, whereas uneven numbers are seen to hold a greater potential for dynamic energy or have a potential to imply change.
A powerful expression of the triadic arrangement can be found at Zuiho-in temple (part of the Daitoku-ji complex, Kyoto) created in 1961 by Mirei Shigemori. The stone arrangement of the south garden also well illustrates the Japanese aesthetic preference for asymmetrical composition. The centre of the arrangement is located to the extreme right hand side, where a powerful group of five stones are located; at the rear of which a tall upright stands supported by two further upright stones descending in height and rising to sharp peaks. The stones are set close and the angles of the flanks of the stones blend seamlessly into one another providing a visual continuity that rising through the triad to the top (and beyond) of the dominant stone. To further enhance the grouping Shigemori set two further stones in close attendance; to the right is a lower inclining stone which features a peak that reflects the Dominant stone, its right hand side flank falling in line with a diagonal line that again continues to the peak of the Dominant stone. To provide a sense of stability to the group on the left side is a lower reclining stone set to lean into the main group, again the outline of this the fifth stone in the group perfectly aligns with the diagonal line running up from left to right that cuts across the verticality of the Dominant stone. The result is a powerful and dynamic arrangement that seems to rear out of the earth, yet it carries a sense of great stability and of being deeply rooted in the earth from which it springs. Shigemori adds depth to this section of the garden by placing another group, this time of three stones, at a lower level in the raked gravel. The Dominant stone of this triad has an angled top that moves the line of connectivity towards the upper five grouping, its sheer flat face very strongly vertical. This is tempered by a low, squat, upright with a slightly rounded top that nestles at the base on the left side anchoring the vertical movement. The whole group is then further anchored by the presence of a very low upright with a flatten top set to the right side. Setting this subordinate stone a little apart from the Dominant opens up a gap between what are otherwise closely set stones that in fact overlap one another. The flatten top of the stone combined with the spatial separation gives the sense of a spiralling movement that rises from this the smallest of the stones right through the entire group, allowing a smooth transition from the very lowest to the very highest.
Shigemori further emphasises triadic element of the entire garden by extending the composition out along the left diagonal plane where it finishes and is held by a low upright stone set by itself in the heavily raked gravel. Between the main axis of the arrangement and this final stone he places several other stones to further reflect the dynamic movements and rhythms. Given that the garden is in a relatively confined space it carries a wonderful sense of flow, which manages complexity and simplicity, movement and harmony. Seen from the verandah the entire garden arrangement is further enhanced by the strong lines imparted by the boundary wall and clipped hedges. Here, these horizontal lines give the space a passive backcloth which throws the stone arrangements into greater relief, whilst at the same time providing a steady, soothing undercurrent to contain the movements. Shigemori‚Äôs garden creation manages to be both contemporary whilst also being respectful to traditions of artistic composition that have deep, ancient, roots in Eastern aesthetics.
Whilst in a garden such as at Zuiho-in Shigeimori employs tight alignments between the forms of the stones to create triadic relationships, in a garden such as Ryoan-ji (created perhaps in the late 15th century), the relationships are more subtlety executed and less obviously defined. Here there is a greater emphasis on the overall disposition of one to another of the five groups of placements that make up the composition. The open spaces between the stone groups clearly have a greater role than simply providing a sense of differentiation and definition. Whilst appearing to be casual enough, the disposition of the stones within their respective groupings, and also between the groups themselves, is clearly the result of a great deal of sensitive aesthetic consideration. The stones themselves have little inherent drama in themselves, yet the overall effect is perhaps even more compelling and persuasive. A sense of mystery, of intrigue, stalks the garden like no other. Perhaps this is what draws the thousands of visitors to the garden. Stones used in such a way in a garden setting seem to act as centres of energy. Emanating from the stones seems to be some mystic energy that is contained within them; perhaps stones continue to radiate in some subtle manner the traces of the forces by which rock was created in the first place. Given that they are forces of energy of such a level of immensity that, ultimately, defy definition or comprehension.
That stones may contain powers or energetic forces was clearly recognised in Sakuteiki, where an important section of the text is taken up with detailing a variety of taboos concerning stone placements and selection. In particular the text warns of the misplacement of stones, or the inappropriate placement of stones, and the dire results that can result from violating taboos.
‚ÄúUsing a stone that once stood upright in a reclining manner or using a reclining stone as a standing stone. If this is done, that stone will definitely become a Phantom stone (reiseki, or spirit stone) and be cursed.‚Äù
‚ÄúDo not set a stone that it falls directly in line with the columns of the building. Violate this taboo and even one‚Äôs descendants will suffer, evil occurrences will abound, and all one‚Äôs one‚Äôs wealth will be lost.‚Äù
‚ÄúHirotaka[2] has said the setting of stones should not be done thoughtlessly. There are many taboos with regard to the setting of stones. Violate just one of them, it is said, and something terrible will befall the master of the house, and his household too, will not continue for long.‚Äù[3]
Such expressions reveal much of the attitude and perception people of that era had towards garden elements, one which we may consider today as being ecocentric, rather than anthropocentric. Stones, and plants, in a garden were recognised as having a energetic force or ki in Japanese (Ê∞ó). Shinto, the native religion of Japan, acknowledged all things, animate as well as inanimate, as having a life force that needed to be respected. Thus to perceive stones as being capable of influencing human affairs would have been quite natural, ultimately all of Nature was to be revered as a divine expression. Rather than being superseded by the establishment of Buddhism, this ancient geomantic view was overlain by an expansion of expression. Hence by the Middle Ages in Japan the practice of naming of garden stones became a common practice. Naming is a way of both animating a quality, but also projecting qualities on to an object.The names for stones were derived from Buddhist, Taoist, Shinto and Confucian sources, as well as stones being named for their function and for scenic effects they purported to hold.
Therefore we have a three stone arrangement known as Sansonseki (‚ÄòThree Deities stones‚Äô), which evokes the presence of the Buddhist trinity (the interpretation of which deities varies widely, but may include Dainichi Nyorai Â§ßÊó•Â¶ÇÊù•, Amida Butsu ÈòøÂº•ÈôÄ‰ªè and Kannon Ë¶≥Èü≥). The Sakuteiki  notes: ‚Äú If a Buddhist Trinity (sansonseki) is placed in the southwest, there will be no curse, neither will malevolent spirits be able to enter.‚Äù One may speculate from this that the purpose of sansonseki  in the garden was to provide a protection to the household. Another Buddhist deity that frequently is associated with gardens is Fud≈ç My≈ç≈ç ‰∏çÂãïÊòéÁéã, this protective figure is associated with waterfalls possibly through his adoption by the mountain priests of the shugend≈ç sect of esoteric Buddhism whose rigorous training in mountains such as Mt Heiei, include purification by standing under waterfalls. A large flat-topped rock is often referred to as a zazenseki, or a meditation stone, as it may well have been placed for precisely that purpose and can be found in several gardens, such as at Saih≈ç-ji, the ‚ÄòMoss temple‚Äô near Kyoto.
'Rock of the Spirit Kings' (shinn≈çseki), 'Never Aging Rock' (fur≈çseki), 'Rock of Ten Thousand Eons' (mang≈çseki), 'Bufo Rock' (gamaishi), all these are names derived from Taoist iconography and have associations with the notion of paradisial islands.
''Master Rock (shugy≈çseki), 'Attendant Rock' (shinseki), 'Yin/Yang Stones (iny≈çseki), 'Status Rock' (kanseki); all these names have Confucian significance, where social status and order is a prime concern.
Shinto references are more vague to deduce but given the animistic content of Shinto iconography stones that refer to animals probably have some significance, such as 'Duck‚Äôs Abode stone' (kamoi ishi), and 'Flying Birds rocks' (toritobi ishi)[4]. Stones found in natural settings known as iwakura have definite associations with Shinto. These are regarded as being places where deities either abide or places at which they may have some communication with humans. Usually iwakura are very large stones and are delineated by a harness of rice straw rope draped around them. Very occasionally such stones are found in the precincts of shrines and temples, through garden use is not at all common.
Amid examples of names for functional stones are:
Takisoe ishi (ÊªùÊ∑ªÁü≥) 'Cascade supporting stones'; these are tall stones placed either side of the Cascade stone over which water flows
Teishuseki (‰∫≠‰∏ª)Áü≥ 'Host‚Äôs stone'; this would be a broad flat stone placed so to give a prime view over the garden.
Teshoku ishi (ÊâãÁá≠)Áü≥ 'Lamp stone'; a flat topped low stone places to the left of a water basin for evening or night tea ceremonies.
Yut≈ç seki(ÊπØÊ°∂Áü≥) 'Warm water basin stone', a low flat topped stone set to the right side of a water basin, it holds a basin of warm water for winter or cold season tea ceremony.
Sekimori ishi (Èñ¢ÂÆàÁü≥) 'Barrier stone'; a convention of the Tea garden, a fist sized stone wraped with sisal which may be placed on a stepping stone, it indicates that particular path is closed and guides a visitor along an alternative path.
Kutsunugi ishi (Ê≤ìËÑ±Áü≥) 'Shoe leaving stone'; a long low flat topped stone at the entry point to a building where outdoor shoes are left before entering.
Scenic stones are stones that are intended to evoke landscape imagery in the imagination of the viewer. The names describe well their symbolic role and use:
Namiuke ishi Êµ™ÂèóÁü≥ 'Wave dividing stone'; a stone placed in a stream that is intended to split the flow, often creating a small pool of sound.
Sancho seki Â±±È†ÇÁü≥ 'Summit stone': a stone set on a earth mound or hill in the garden.
Sawatobi ishi Ê≤¢È£õÁü≥ 'Water crossing stones'; stepping stones set across a stream or shallow pond.
Shumisen ishiÈ†àÂº•Â±±Áü≥ 'Mt. Shumisen stone'; a tall upright stone that evokes the mystic Buddhist mountain, also is generally read as a paradisial symbol.
Funatsuki ishi ËàπÁùÄÁü≥ 'Boat Landing stone'; flat stones set into the bank of a pond from which one steps onto dry land after disembarking. Boating was a popular activity in the larger stroll gardens. Such stones are sometimes used in gardens where the pond is too small to use for boating, but their presence still would evoke the idea of boating.
D≈çjiseki Á´•Â≠êÁü≥ 'Children stones'; usually a scattering of small stones offset from a prominent stone, the effect is of a scattering of children running about. The pattern of the layout of such stones would be carefree and intentionally unstructured.
It should not be taken from the above notes on names that a garden is required to be composed of named stones, there are many gardens whose stone placements have not been designated any ‚Äòmeaning‚Äô. Gardens where the stones are arranged purely for visual and/or spatial purposes. Undoubtedly in the Edo period in Japan (1603-1867), the use of named stones in gardens became very popular, almost formulaic. The intention of this was generally to evoke associations in the mind of the viewer thereby increasing the level of engagement that the viewer could have with the garden. In garden manuals complied about that period and earlier stones are certainly designated names, but there was no standard for this, knowledge of garden making techniques was subject to guild like limitations. One had to be an initiate into the practice to know of certain things, and teaching related to garden making was passed from generation to generation orally, much as it still is into the 21st century.
A successful stone arrangement is one that recognizes that the primary material that the garden creator works with is not simply the outward form of the stone but its inner energetic patterns. A stone today has come to appear a certain way through the unique configuration of the forces of its creation as stone, weathering, patina and also its history. This process has taken millions of years to achieve, it is easy to overlook and take this for granted, but it is something that is important the stone arranger or garden creator needs to bear in mind. Perception and a profound sensitivity to the materials with which one works, is a vital element in the creation of any artwork. Blending a group of stones together into a coherent whole, whilst allowing space and time for the imagination of the viewer to be part of that process of recognition and comprehension, is something that is absorbed as part of the training of a Japanese garden creator. This principal extends right through the garden, through the use of planting, the relationship between buildings and the garden and by the use of land-shaping and the relationship between the garden and its external environment too. Thus the practice of setting stones becomes an art form in itself, employing aesthetic concerns, as much as techniques concerned with rhythm, space, pattern and any symbolic content that may be projected through the work. The garden is not a formulaic construction and it draws deeply on the sensitivity of its creator in order to work well, that is, for the garden to reach and communicate with the viewer the garden creator has to find the very qualities he or she wishes to project outwardly with themselves. The movement outwards is also a movement inwards.
Above all, in practice the selection, use and setting of stones becomes an intuitive practice in experienced garden creators. The Sakuteiki is clear that the stone setter should ‚Äòfollow the requesting mood of the stone‚Äô, and this is probably the most important element of the use of stones in the Japanese garden. It is not so much the ego of the garden creator that is of principal importance, but rather there is a process of sublimation of the creator‚Äôs ego to recognise the primacy of the materials themselves. The garden creator trains his or her eye and heart to see the materials as they are, and to be able to use them as such. Interpreting the requirements of site, client and materials is the key to successful garden making. Nowhere is this more apparent and important in the setting of stones that has been noted above is one of the key practices in the creation of Japanese gardens. It has always been so, and no doubt will continue to be so.
Japanese gardens are generally classified according to the nature of the terrain, either tsuki-yama (‚Äúartificial hills‚Äù) or hira-niwa (‚Äúlevel ground‚Äù), each having particular features. Tsuki-yama consists of hills and ponds, and hira-niwa consists of flat ground designed to represent a valley or moor; tsuki-yama may include a portion laid out as hira-niwa. Each type may, furthermore, be treated in any one of the three degrees of elaboration mentioned. Hill gardens as a rule include a stream and a pond of real water, but there is a special variation, the kare-sansui (dried-up landscape) style, in which rocks are composed to suggest a waterfall and its basin and, for a winding stream or a pond, gravel or sand is used to symbolize water or to suggest seasonally dried-up terrain.
Japanese gardens are characterized by: the waterfall, of which there are ten or more different arrangements; the spring and stream to which it gives rise; the lake; hills, built up from earth excavated from the basin for the lake; islands; bridges of many varieties; and the natural guardian stones. The selection and effective distribution of the stones are a prime consideration in garden design. After endless experiments and deep pondering, the best and most subtle compositions were handed down by means of drawings. A studied irregularity in the arrangement of stepping stones is a noteworthy feature of the chanoyu garden, where beauty and use are combined.
In modern Japanese gardens, flowers are few and evergreens popular. Simplicity, restraint, and consistency are sought rather than gaiety, showiness, or the obvious variations of the seasons. Evergreen foliage is preferred to the changing aspect of deciduous trees, although maples and a few others are used. As in the case of stones, trees must be distributed in the garden in harmony with their natural origin and habit of growth. Wells, decorative and useful alike, stone water basins in endless variety, stone lanterns and figures, pagodas, arbours, and summer houses are the most characteristic garden furnishings. Together with gateways and fences‚Äîparticularly the widely varying sode-gaki (‚Äúsleeve fences‚Äù) attached to the side of a house to screen certain portions‚Äîthese elements harmonize the natural beauty of the garden with the architectural features of the house.
In the course of history, the objective standpoint in garden making gave way to the subjective impulse. Various philosophic principles and religious doctrines were applied to the making of gardens, not so much to interpret those principles and doctrines as to rationalize the aesthetics of garden design. Natural rocks distributed to illustrate familiar philosophic principles and even beliefs of all sorts still continue to some extent to influence the general design of the garden. The aim is to bring humanity close to nature and every conceivable means may be employed to realize it. Some master garden designers represented landscapes of China and Japan in miniature. They planned the garden and planted trees to give the illusion of the view extending over and beyond its immediate confines, but at the same time they designed it to be a secluded sylvan retreat, great ingenuity being displayed in both directions. In some instances, only a few stones in the narrow strip of ground suffice to suggest a great expanse of landscape, included as background.
Sen Riky≈´, in his garden at Sakai, obstructed the open view of the sea so that only when guests stooped at the stone basin to perform ablutions prior to entering the cha-shitsu did they catch an unexpected glimpse through the trees of shimmering sea, thus suddenly being made to realize the relation of the dipperful of water lifted from the basin to the vast expanse of sea and of themselves to the universe.
Throughout history the Japanese have tried to emphasize in their gardens the charm of restraint; beauty is so concealed that it may be discovered individually, thus providing a thrill of joy to the soul like that which comes from doing a good deed in stealth. In its ideal at least, the Japanese garden, which always has been part of the home, is by no means merely an arrangement of beautiful places. It aims at satisfying a human craving for the natural and, by supplying peace and repose, at offering a retreat in which one can find spiritual recreation and sustenance.
tones‚Äîlarge and small‚Äîare a major component of most Japanese gardens, and must have been important from the very beginnings of garden design. As Takei's and Keane's recent translation of the Sakuteiki points out, the opening line of that oldest of Japanese garden manuals equates the creation of gardens with the setting of stones. The "meaning" and the aesthetic appeal of garden stones have been the subjects of much analysis by the students of these gardens, but it is a controversial topic. There can be little doubt that the use of stones and the reverence shown them have roots in Shinto belief, but the exact nature of stone worship in prehistoric Japan can only be surmised. That the selection and placing of stones in the historic period has a spiritual component cannot be denied, however, as that responsibility often fell to the priestly caste. The Sakuteiki specifically mentions the secrets of rock-placing and associates them with the priest En no Enjari. Indeed, stones and the placing of stones are the major concern in garden design according to that ancient text, particularly since the poor placement of stones would lead to misfortune and illness. 
The art and craft of the Japanese garden continues to thrive today after well over 1,300 years in Japan and for the last 150 years in various points west and east. It is difficult to define one reason for the almost instant endearment of these beautiful spaces, but for me, it has always been the Japanese garden‚Äôs ability to capture the essence of the greater natural world as well as its ability to adapt to almost any type of site and topography. Most of us are only familiar with the Japanese garden in public-park settings, and while beautiful, these gardens would likely be far out of our range in terms of cost‚Äîand perhaps scale‚Äîto even be given a second thought as an option for our own homes. There are, however, elements of design within nearly all Japanese gardens that can be integrated into a non-Japanese garden with great success. The key is not to paint a Japanese face on your garden in an effort to make it look or feel authentically Japanese. Take cues, instead, from Japanese-gardening techniques to evoke the peace and tranquility that these gardens inspire. To do this, we will need to look closely at some of the elements of traditional Japanese-garden design.
Japan is one of the few areas in the world that places such strong cultural significance on the seasons as they relate to daily life and the feelings and moods that they evoke. It‚Äôs easy to understand, then, the importance of the seasons within the garden. The best gardens in Japan, for example, would rarely, if ever, feature a Japanese-maple cultivar with red leaves during the growing season. The seasonal color change is what is desirable.
Spring is the period of rebirth, so deciduous plants that bloom or go directly into leaf are a desired feature. The goal is a brief, subdued color display that is appropriate to the season. Summer
in the Japanese garden is the season of green, rather than the riotous display of flowering shrubs and perennials often seen in western gardens. In the days before air-conditioning, nothing was more satisfying than retreating to the green of the summer garden with, perhaps, the sound of trickling water to cool you down.
Fall gives us a chance to look back, and the drop of colorful leaves signals the year‚Äôs end. Winter is a time of rest for the garden, but it is also a time to see the scaffold of the leafless trees and the way that snow dresses the evergreen plants.
Choose small, deli¬≠cate, pale-colored flowers
in spring.
Opt for plants with healthy foliage in summer, rather than ones with lots of flowers.
Feature distinct foliage-color changes and intriguing structure in fall and winter.
Perhaps the main thing that converted me to using the principles of Japanese gardens is the way that the Japanese home and garden are seamlessly integrated. This is largely due to Japanese homes featuring floor-to-ceiling views of the garden, which effectively brings the outside into the house. While many of our homes feature windows that can only be looked through while standing, others have homes with sliding doors and floor plans not unlike the traditional Japanese home.
That said, when the garden is intended or has the potential to be viewed from a fixed location, such as inside the house, there shouldn‚Äôt be distraction or clutter in between to diminish the experience. Avoid planting right outside a window. Not every inch needs to be filled with plants or stone groupings. There needs to be empty space‚Äîsuch as a lawn area, a sea of gravel, or a pond‚Äîthat gives the viewer a sense of depth.
Also, numerous techniques allow us also to trick the eye into believing that the garden is wider or deeper than it is. A long, narrow space, for example, might use sparse planting in the foreground with increasingly heavier plantings in the middle and back to constrict the rectangular shape of the site and make the viewer look to just one distant vantage point.
Selecting the best possible materials is important in constructing any garden. Become familiar with the materials available to you before you start. High-quality materials can be expensive, and it is better to wait until they fit your budget than to compromise and go with inferior materials just to get the job done. Consulting with a professional, as well, might be well worth the investment. When it comes to plants, consider species that are well adapted to your area, even though they might not be what you would immediately consider typical for a Japanese garden. Likewise, take into account the maintenance that a plant will require in the beginning to save you headaches‚Äîand an overgrown mess‚Äîlater. A well-maintained garden of marginal design will far outshine the best-designed garden that is given no care.
We have all heard the phrase ‚Äútoo much of a good thing.‚Äù Overpowering a garden with a poor architectural choice, ostentatious stone groupings, or too many specimen trees gives the viewer a sense of uneasiness, which is the opposite of our goal. Lanterns and pagodas, for example, have a place in some gardens, but if they are used as the element to define the space as a Japanese garden, it would be better to start over and find a path that did not require their use for credibility. Directional signs and plant labels should also be avoided because they are unnecessary and clutter the garden.
Japanese gardens are not collections of Japanese plants but, rather, arrangements of plants and materials that evoke landscape scenery. When we try to create an area that makes us think of the mountains, a meadow, or the seashore, we use the plants that commonly grow there. To create a scene where no one part over¬≠powers the rest, avoid mixing wildly contrasting foliage textures and colors in favor of a more harmonious blend of plants.
The well-conceived garden should have landforms, plantings, and pathways that relate in scale to the size of the human body. This makes the viewer feel familiar with the site conditions and, thus, more comfortable. Japanese gardens are created on this human scale, sometimes by using techniques of abstract representation or distilling the essence of the scenic parts of the natural world to impart their mood to the garden. When using large stones to evoke the feeling of mountains or a water course, for example, it is important to use a variety of sizes and shapes to effectively replicate what we see in nature. Similarly, plants must be selected and maintained at a variety of sizes and shapes in an effort to offer a feeling of old and new. This keeps the view from becoming stagnant with plantings that have grown to a similar size and offer little variation for the eye to move up and down naturally through the composition.
If you consider the variously arranged garden stones and contour of the land as the skeleton of the garden, then it is equally important to consider the ideal size of the attending plantings; that‚Äôs because the stones and mounds do not get any bigger, while the plantings do. The solution in Japan has been to prune all plants in the garden to keep them in proportion to the layout of the rest of the garden, but this can be accomplished with careful plant choices, as well.
It is rare to see large shade trees in a garden in Japan, simply because they are out of proportion with the rest of the garden. These trees are reserved for parks and temple gardens where their size is better in scale with the surrounding space and the archi¬≠tecture. Large shade trees are a common feature of American gardens, however, and often a necessity for summer shade. A way to keep these trees is to use additional plantings of smaller trees that transition the height of the trees back to the ground plane so that they aren‚Äôt disproportionately larger than everything else in the garden.
Go easy on contrast and color
Color and contrast are wonderful for making an exciting garden, but the power of a Japanese garden comes from its ability to evoke a sense of calmness from the visitor. This vignette has very few bright colors‚Äîand even those are kept small and far away.
Stay in scale
When the size of the elements of a garden are too large, a person feels
insignificant; when they are too small, one can feel clumsy and awkward. By keeping this path just the right width for a person to walk on and keeping the plantings down to a size where one can interact with them, this vignette has a scale that contributes to the peaceful mood of the space.
Feel free to have nothing
Gardeners often have the impulse to put a plant into any open space that they see. But the empty spaces between plants gives everything room to create its own impact. This vignette makes use of gravel and low ground covers to allow everything to breathe.
